          "description": "<p>CalibrateSDR is designed to accurately determine the frequency offset of an SDR via an IQ recording sample. Cheaper SDRs use a low-quality crystal oscillator which usually has a large offset from the ideal frequency. Furthermore, that frequency offset will change as the dongle warms up or as the ambient temperature changes. The end result is that any signals received will not be at the correct frequency, and they would drift as the temperature changes. \nCalibrateSDR can be used with almost any SDR to determine the frequency offset. As of now, it uses the synchronization channel symbols from DAB+ digital audio stations to determine the offset. The primary focus of this project is to extend the applicability towards more signal standards, so as to make it helpful for the SDR community. As DAB+ is mainly used in Europe, Signal standards like GSM, LTE, NOAA-Weather Satellites, DVB-T (use their sync pulses within the data) can be used. Currently, it uses the pyrtlsdr package, which makes it work with RTL-SDR. Piping the API to work with other SDRs will also make the project have a wide range of applications in the SDR Community.</p>\n",

It is claimed, however, that the fuzzer adjusted for the target program that one wants to fuzz is the most effective one.<br>\nLibAFL offers those functionalities, with which users can customize the fuzzer or even extend the fuzzer tailored for each target program. However, since it is still at the early stage of development, some of the powerful scheduling algorithms have not been incorporated into LibAFL yet.<br>\nThis proposal is to implement two effective scheduling algorithms, the AFLFast, and the MOpt algorithm into LibAFL.

Differences in the output of the new shader and the original one can be caused by bugs in the driver. Thus, our task involves expanding the set of transformations by building sets of transformation classes and writing their corresponding tests and fuzzer passes.</p>\n<p>Our main task involves the WebGPU Shading Language, a new shading language featured by WebGPU. Since web browsers will have WebGPU, a secure implementation is crucial. To achieve a high test coverage, we use coverage-guided fuzzing. It uses program instrumentation to trace the code coverage reached by each input fed to a fuzz target. The information is then used to make informed decisions that maximize coverage, and thus increase the effectiveness of finding software bugs and security vulnerabilities. This project involves automatic fuzzing using LibFuzzer. Since LibFuzzer-based custom mutators mutate test cases in a domain-specific way, effective designing and implementing Tint-specific custom mutators are essential for this project to succeed.</p>\n",

This summer I am planning to add a Welcome screen for the new users and use the spotlight feature to guide all the new users with every feature in the app. The major fix will be memory leaks, which hinder a lot in the performance of the application. I am going to enable deep linking and allow users to vote through the app itself. Adding a search bar to search elections is on my to-do list. Manually adding every voter and candidate can be hectic for a large list, so I plan to make it easier by importing these data from excel sheets. I will be adding more visualization techniques in Result Fragment and also export the result in excel format to external apps or share it as a png file. I will connect the application to Firebase, and enable crashlytics, analytics, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for better app retention. In addition to this, I am planning on multi-theme support and writing unit tests for all the business logic implemented.</p>\n",

But this language pair still lacks an open-source machine translation system. \nMy proposal is to fill this gap as much as possible during this GSoC2021 program. \nSince Uzbek and Kazakh languages from the same language family, they are closely related in terms of grammar, word order and similarity in vocabulary, so I will try to make a bidirectional translation, with a more focus on Kazakh -&gt; Uzbek side, as Uzbek is my native language and I possess very basic knowledge in Kazakh.</p>\n",

Although the vast majority of SOTA source separation algorithms are built using Python-based frameworks, PyTorch’s C++ torchscript API provides an elegant solution for deploying python models in C++ applications. In Audacity, this would introduce the opportunity for the user to choose from a collection of domain-specific pretrained models, each suited for a different task (e.g. speech or music).  Additionally, it would set the foundational code for future integration of deep models designed for different tasks, such as speech recognition and audio classification. The goal of this work is not only to integrate source separation algorithms into Audacity, but more importantly to lay the groundwork for an extensible suite of open-source, deep learning-based music information retrieval (MIR) tools hosted by the world’s most popular free and open-source audio editor.</p>\n",

The registration is done by the study administrator to get the relation between WSI image coordinates and x-y stage coordinates.\nThis project aims to develop the interface to do the local registration and global registration and compute the transformation bias. This will be incorporated with the existing camicroscope code base and added as a plug-in to control the microscope stage movement and lens selection so that comparative analysis of digital WSI image and real-time microscopic image of the same sample is possible.</p>\n",

Python is the most versatile as well as the most used programming language and has huge community support. Casbin-CPP has the potential to support new PyCasbin to compound the benefits of both languages through language bindings and extension libraries. Currently, the project uses Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++ for testing and Microsoft’s Azure DevOps pipelines for CI. CTest is truly cross-platform and can be configured using GitHub Actions for consistent and better CI.</p>\n<p>Project Ideas are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modernizing the project with C++17 standard and Google’s benchmarking tool</li>\n<li>Implement Python bindings for Casbin-CPP using pybind11 library</li>\n<li>Implement testing based on CTest and set up workflows for Continuous Integration through GitHub Actions</li>\n</ul>\n",

However, to allow for a large variety of endpoint types to integrate with Ceph, we are encountered with some inconvenience on these various protocols from different service infrastructure. The workaround for the notification brings the burden of adaptor deployment, communication and translation overhead.AMQP 1.0 is the latest standard for AMQP. It focuses on core features which are necessary for interoperability at Internet scale, and it contains less explicit routing than previous versions. Even though Ceph has supported the AMQP(ver 0.9.1) natively, the gap between these two protocol specifications cannot be ignored. The next level AMQP(ver 1.0) requires a completely different client library.  AMQP 1.0 brokers are supported by Apache Qpid/ActiveMQ project and Azure platform, etc. To address this problem, we should support the AMQP 1.0 natively in the Ceph Rados Gateway. This requires adding the qpid-proton client library to the Rados Gateway code base, and use it to send notifications to AMQP 1.0 compatible brokers.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Storage is one of the main limiting factors to the recording of information from proton-proton collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at CERN in Geneva. Hence, the ATLAS experiment at the LHC uses a trigger system, which selects and transfers interesting events to the data storage system. However, if those events are buried in large backgrounds and difficult to identify as a signal by the trigger system, they will also be discarded together with the background. To alleviate this problem, various compression algorithms are proposed to reduce the size of the data that is recorded. One of those algorithms is an autoencoder (AE) network that tries to implement an approximation to the identity, f(x) = x. Its goal is to create a lower-dimensional representation of the input data in a latent space. Then using this latent representation the model can reconstruct its input. Moreover, two advanced families of AEs are proposed, the Variational and the Adversarial AE. Next, various combinations of different compression algorithms are tested to compress and construct accurate representations of the input data. Finally, the studied AEs are implemented for anomaly detection.</p>\n",

It is used both directly and throughout other packages in the library, so any performance improvements made to this package will pay dividends elsewhere. The package has already been a major target of performance optimization, but one approach that hasn’t yet been fully explored is the use of SIMD, a type of parallel computation where the processor operates on several data values at a time. The introduction of SIMD optimizations to the AABB tree has the potential to substantially improve performance by better taking advantage of the capabilities of modern computer processors.</p>\n",

However, most of the applied configurations can be seen by viewing the ConifgMap in the Kubernetes cluster. The main issue is that ConfigMap does not stay reconciled with the active daemon configurations. This means that if we change any configuration in the ConfigMap, it is not immediately reflected in Cilium. Cilium needs to be restarted to apply those configurations. Depending on kernel configurations, It may happen that ConfigMap and daemon both show different active configurations. So, this project aims at improving the existing <code>cilium config</code> command to expose all active configurations.</p>\n<p>Add subcommand :</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>cilium encrypt status,</code> which displays information on the current status of the IPSec configurations </li>\n<li><code>cilium encrypt flush,</code> which flushes the current XFRM States of the node.</li>\n</ol>\n",

It is easy to change the disk size on the cloud too. This causes issues in the Kubernetes cluster using OpenEBS as the changes in the device properties will not be reflected immediately in the BD resource.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to solve the issue above by adding functionality in the NDM to detect changes in the mount-points and capacity of supported block devices and propagate them immediately to the corresponding BD resource.</p>\n",

Our task then is to extract the cause-effect entity pairs (e.g., Peaceful_Revolution, German_reunification) from the wikipedia text. We combine the idea of using the seed data (e.g., the known cause-effect entity pairs) with training a classifier (e.g., a discriminative model--- LSTM ), so as to discover more cause-effect entity pairs from wikipedia text, which is known as distant supervised relation extraction. The procedures include the pattern matching, knowledge exploration, entity recognition, entity mapping, etc. Eventually, we aim to acquire more reliable causal relations between entities of DBpedia.</p>\n",

I would train several relation extraction models with different parameters (for example, different training data, classifier, classifier inputs, inputs encoding, number of relations to be extracted, etc), add them to the  DeepPavlov storage, and give the user an opportunity to load them (and, occasionally, additionally train with his/her own training data) and find the one that would suit his/her data the best way.

          "description": "<p>Addition of <strong>deferred length variables</strong> in <strong>Fortran 2003</strong> provides a user with an utility to leave the responsibility of allocating the required space to a variable on the compiler. A deferred length variable is either <code>pointer</code> or <code>allocatable</code>. Compiler during execution allocates space based upon the value to be assigned to a variable.<br>\n<em>For eg:</em> If the value to be assigned to a character variable is <code>\"spiderman\"</code>, then the compiler will automatically allocate a space required to store this character sequence of length 9 and a reference to this space will be stored in the variable. Similarly, if a new character sequence, let’s say, <code>\"batman\"</code>(which is of length 6) is assigned to this same variable then the compiler will allocate a space required to store <code>\"batman\"</code> and a reference to this space will overwrite the previously stored reference in the variable. Thus, space required by the variable is constant as it is not storing the actual character sequence and is rather storing the reference to the space where the character sequence is actually stored.</p>\n<p><em>Goals of the project:</em><br>\n1).

Atarashi license scanner implements multiple text statistics and information retrieval algorithms. \nScanCode Toolkit is a very established license scanner similar to Nomos or Monk. It is a simple python based command line scanner that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It implements a number of different approaches and integrates these into one application for identifying and classifying license relevant content in packages.\nThe basic idea is to use the command line interface from the ScanCode package in order to be called right from the FOSSology application.

These types of simulations are a necessary step in any hardware design. It is intrinsically a hard problem, and even commercial simulators run slow compared to the real hardware, which can be several orders of magnitude faster. On the open-source side, Verilator is one of the most famous players and offers a competitive simulation speed time compared to the closed-source ones. We will base our work on this tool. \nThis project will consider that modern processors rely on Network-On-Chip (NoC) to communicate several cores in the same chip. The idea would be to use this hardware partition into consideration and make a stand-alone simulation per core and communicate through OpenMPI.

          "description": "<p>The open-source RISC-V instruction set architecture is gaining interest throughout industry and academia. One advantage of RISC-V is the ability to add custom instruction extensions to the processor targeting specific applications.  A joint project between Embecosm and Southampton university recently developed an open source ISA extension for the CV32E40P RISC-V core to accelerate neural network inference acceleration (<a href=\"https://github.com/AI-Vector-Accelerator\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/AI-Vector-Accelerator</a>). The verification of the AI vector extensions project currently exists only as a Verilator model, and speed ups are based on cycle counts, with no insight to any impact on clock speed in actual silicon. There is no pipeline and everything is single cycle because there are no timing constraints in Verilator. This project aims to take the existing work and bring it up on a Nexys A7 FPGA platform.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The memory to CPU bottleneck is one of the fundamental and essential issues of commodity processors. With sweeply increasing computing speed, instructions might spend much of their time in waiting queues during read-store access. Nevertheless, there are also many available OS and microarchitecture designs for solving this performance complication. One of the important is the multi-level Translation Lookahead Buffer(TLB) Implementation. Based on the cache locality principle, it aids to keep the frequently used address translations near the core, hence amortizes the waiting time for instruction fetching and load-store units. With many levels in place, the less is the frequency of misses, the better is the performance. Thus, this proposal will aim to enhance the current TLB structure of the CVA6 (Ariane) core to a multi-level with L2 TLB on top of the existing L1 TLBs.</p>\n<p>Here, CVA6 is the application class and Linux bootable 64-bit RISC-V 1.7GHz CPU Core.

Remembering all those combinations is hard, especially when not using them often, also it turned out a lot of people are not even aware features like the screen recorder exist. The plan for this project is to unify both the screenshot and the screen recorder functionality within a single UI that's part of gnome-shell.

The behavior of the electromagnetic wave is closely dependent on the material in which it propagates. Some dispersive media have quite complex electromagnetic properties depending on the wavelength. This, for example, means that for different frequencies the wave can propagate with a different speed in different materials. This significantly affects the solver’s output. The main goal of the project is to enhance series of scripts, which modelled electromagnetic properties of the variety range of materials. Initial series of scripts have been prepared, however, their technical improvement and coupling with main software gprMax is required.</p>\n",

Its compiler internally uses a Term Rewriting System (TRS) in order to simplify complex expressions, which comprises over a thousand handwritten rewrite rules added by human compiler engineers. In order to strengthen the TRS by finding new rules that can rewrite input expressions that the TRS currently fails to simplify, a synthesizer was used to automatically generate 4127 verifiably sound rules. Experiments have shown that adding these rules lowers peak memory usage by up to 50%, while having relatively insignificant impact on runtime performance. However, adding every such rule increases compile-time and compiler code size. This project aims to address this problem by incrementally testing and assessing each rule and subsets of the rules, while adding them to the compiler only if they necessarily contribute to the peak memory reductions shown in the experiment or other improvements in performance.</p>\n",

While the untyped version can initially be easier to use and experiment with, the typed version offers static analysis of tensor’s shape, layout, precision, and compute device. The typed version not only helps with debugging and maintainability but also offers better support for type-driven development via GHC features like type holes. However, it is currently difficult to mix the two approaches, e.g., statically specifying tensor’s embedding size while keeping other dimensions unchecked is not possible. Gradual typing is the proposed solution that fuses the two APIs by adding Torch.GraduallyTyped type. The new API allows for more granular control by letting the user choose which properties of the tensor should be given a static type. The goal of the project is to bring maturity to the gradually typed tensor API, add missing features, and experiment with new ideas.</p>\n",

The flagship server hydrus can only serve static data and does not provide a way to define custom server-side logic. A new feature for dynamic endpoint could be added so that a developer would be able to define logic/functions  for how the incoming data is processed on the server end. A lot of improvements are possible in CRUD operations of hydrus, including setting up constraints and handling errors on the server-side depending upon how the data is stored in a Collection.

Although developed for MRI originally, it has gained popularity within the EEG and MEG realms. Converting raw data to the BIDS standard is not difficult but requires a lot of time if done by hand. Currently software like mne-bids and Biscuit are available to assist and facilitate this conversion but there is still no automated way to produce a valid BIDS dataset for the EEG and MEG use-cases. Mostly what is missing is metadata. Here a python package is proposed to be able to infer the missing information from files accompanying the EEG and MEG files and/or a single bids-conversion example provided by the user. The idea of having human-readable configuration files is also explored since this would help the sharing of common conversion parameters within similar communities. If this proposal was successfully implemented then batch conversion of BIDS datasets in the EEG and MEG cases would be realized. It is hoped that this package becomes the backend of an hypothetical web application that assists this conversion of MEG-EEG datasets.</p>\n",

One of these barriers has been the accessibility of shared data; it takes extensive time and effort to understand different data formats and determine which datasets are best suited for the scientific questions being asked. This project is an important step in addressing this challenge. The goal of this project is to convert publicly available datasets to the standardized NeuroData Without Borders (NWB) format so that they can be better interpreted and reused by other researchers. The data will then be made available for interactive analysis and visualization through the NWB explorer on the Open Source Brain repository. By using a standardized data format, researchers can more quickly work with new data and develop analysis methods to apply to a wide variety of datasets. The ability to easily explore and visualize data will also allow researchers to quickly assess the contents of the data and if they can reuse it. Thus, the results of this project will contribute to an important resource for scientists.</p>\n",

Under the existing implementation of the active segmentation platform, it only supports users with a limited way to load the ground truth for learning ( at the moment only as of the region on interest format (ROI)). Thus, this reduced the usability of the tool and it urges the users to convert the ground truth to the specific format which is designed to be used within the application.

This type of time series data is often related to classification problems. EEG and MEG are also central to human-computer interface research. The question we wish to address on this project is, what is the best way to make predictions from ECG/EEG and MEG? We will treat the problem as time series classification. We have an existing database of publicly available labeled EEG/MEG datasets, tools in both Python for time series classification and collaborators who are experts in traditional techniques for analyzing EEG/MEG. Our ultimate goal is an effective automated end-to-end pipeline for EEG/MEG classification using open-source software such as sktime. This would encourage reproducible research in the field and facilitate more widespread analysis.</p>\n",

Several tools and frameworks have been developed to look at different statistical dependencies among multivariate datasets. Among these, information theory offers a powerful and versatile framework; notably, it allows detecting high-order interactions that determine the joint informational role of a group of variables.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to collect and refine existing metrics of high-order interactions currently implemented in Matlab or Java, and integrate them in a unified python-based toolbox. The main deliverable of the project is a toolbox, whose inputs are the measurements of different variables plus some parameters, and whose outputs are the measures of higher-order interdependencies.

The game is inspired by a hugely popular 2D game “Hollow Knight”.\nThe main character of the game is Batro who is the king of the Batona kingdom. At each level, king Batro fights with one of the evil monsters and crosses the hurdles and In the last level, the king fights with Giant Monster Martian and frees his Kingdom from the evil Monsters.\nThe player follows Batro in his journey. The game story is easily depicted through cinematic cutscenes for better insight. The game is very easy to play and get into, with on-screen controls, and a fairly simple UI. The game is playable on both phones and on a smart TV without looking at the phone's screen while using the phone as a gamepad. This game shows how the ‘Pocket Code’ app can be used to develop high-quality video games if used efficiently and effectively.</p>\n",

These obstacles lead to a lack of support for state-of-the-art string constraint solvers in SPF. This proposal outlines changes to SPF that would allow integration of Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-LIB) compliant solvers with minimal effort and no modifications to existing code. Further, string constraint solvers that are not fully SMT-LIB compliant and require specific translations could be integrated with the addition of a single translation class and no modifications to existing code.</p>\n",

The target benchmark to beat would be “1 auth and rep (using authrep.xml endpoint)” per request. The filter will be written in Rust and then later “translated” into WASM code packaged as WASM Module which is loaded on WASM VMs spun up by a runtime (V8, WAVM, or Wasmtime) embedded inside the Envoy. Many advantages come with using the WASM module instead of the native C++ extension like dynamically loading the filter extension, abstraction from the underlying CPU and programming language used, and being safe from crashing the proxy when a developer makes a mistake. Even though the module is sandboxed, it has the capability for I/O as described in the ABI Specification which empowers us with access to shared data storage (key-value based) and a message queue used in this project.</p>\n",

With its main concern over the racing track, the Formula 1 (F1) setting solves the line following objective well. However, the presence of 2 separate pipelines for RL and DL is confusing to the users. The DL base works on the JDERobot app, while the RL base takes the privilege of gym-gazebo. These two bases are unable to communicate with each other. Also, the current framework does not leverage the full capabilities of testing scenarios and robots. Apart from line-following, F1 racing for autonomous maneuvers and drone racing has gained much popularity. Although these settings are highly derivative, it requires few significant changes in the control architecture and modularity wrt multiple robot settings. This project’s primary goal is to move towards more extensive support and documentation of Behavior Studio to suit the same RL environment or DL brain to multiple robots with continuous control integration. The advantages of such changes will make the framework more user-friendly and adaptive to various tasks and robot settings.</p>\n",

KIO-FUSE has not been through regression tests and chances are, doing so would uncover bugs that previously went undetected. KIO-FUSE is updated fairly frequently and new features are still being added, making regression testing a necessity to prevent new bugs from creeping in.</p>\n<p>The lack of regression tests in KIO-FUSE's current testing suite can be fixed by integrating XFSTESTS with it. XFSTESTS is considered as the quintessential filesystem regression testing suite and KIO-FUSE would benefit greatly from it. A more rigorous testing regime would translate to an even more robust and reliable filesystem. Testing KIO-FUSE would mean we're testing KIO slaves as well. As of now, XFSTESTS doesn't support FUSE, and that'll have to be added as a part of this project. FUSE support for XFSTESTS would be a major plus since it'd allow hundreds of filesystems written using FUSE to be tested.</p>\n<p>The project not only benefits KIO, KIO-FUSE and KDE, but the FOSS community as a whole.</p>\n",

This application would allow the user to view, create, modify, and delete calendar events with full Akonadi integration.

Following the advance of Deep Learning, digiKam development team has been working on the Deep Learning implementation of Faces engine since 2018.  During the past few years, with the huge effort of digiKam developers and the great support from users, the Faces engine has been improved gradually.</p>\n<p>However, the Faces engine still has some issues that were not yet eliminated. For example, in the core algorithm, we still get many false positives because the faces engine tries to include all the faces to the known range of labels. In the face pipeline, a lot of implicit memory conversion between QImage, DImg and OpenCV Mat, which for some reasons, adds noise to the images.</p>\n<p>Therefore, for this 2021 Google Summer of Code, we are going to improve the  detection/recognition performance with outlier faces suppression (i.e. new faces should not be counted as untagged faces), the ability to work on large datasets, and an ease-of-use face workflow improvement.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>With the increasing number of satellites launched into space, orbital congestion is escalating ever-more rapidly. This eventually increases the probability of a variety of space events where some might be catastrophic while others serve as a source of beneficial information of scientific interest. As a result, it would be advantageous to detect such contingencies. The potentially harmful ones like orbital collisions can be prevented, and others would allow us to extract meaningful insights about the satellite dynamics. This would ultimately assist in devising optimal orbital design and maintenance strategies.</p>\n<p>The proposed project aims to add event detectors by implementing raw orbital algorithms allowing for increased efficiency and enhanced functionality and configuring them in high-level API. This would ensure swift processing of computationally intensive algorithms while simultaneously allowing to render an easy-to-use API to the user. Consequently, it would allow us to promptly recognize various intricate orbital mechanisms and formulate effective policies based on the outcomes.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located\nnear Geneva, Switzerland. The CMS experiment detects the resulting particles from the collusion and measures their kinematics using various sub detectors working in concert. High momentum muons are significant objects for many physics analyses at CMS. Therefore, an accurate momentum assignment scheme differentiating low momentum muons (background) from high momentum muons (signal) is crucial to the Endcap Muon Track Finder (EMTF) trigger. The first algorithm implemented in the trigger system was a discretized boosted decision tree. In this study, we will study the use of deep learning algorithms at the trigger level that requires microsecond level latency and therefore highly optimized inference. We will develop and benchmark the graph neural networks (GNN) for momentum regression in the trigger system. As deliverables, we will present the benchmarkings of deep network model inference for muon momentum assignment for prompt and displaced particles.</p>\n",

Simulating the particle showers and interactions in the LHC detectors is both time consuming and computationally expensive. Present fast simulation approaches based on non-parametric techniques can improve the speed of the full simulation chain but suffer from lower levels of fidelity. For this reason, alternative methods based on machine learning can provide faster solutions, while maintaining a high level of fidelity. The main goal of a fast simulator is to map the events from the generation level directly to the reconstruction level. That being said, we aim to investigate the efficiency of deep generative models in simulating event reconstructions in a given detector, hence potentially replacing conventional complex algorithms.</p>\n",

One of the challenges of studying dark matter is actually finding it, as it is only noticeable due to gravitational interactions. Fortunately, recent results have shown that strong gravitational lensing can be used as a probe for studying dark matter’s substructure. Unsupervised learning algorithms are particularly interesting in this field because they allow for the identification of dark matter substructure without a prior theoretical model assumption. While the performance of these algorithms is very promising, there is still a large gap when compared to supervised learning algorithms. One promising possibility is to use domain adaptation techniques to fine tune the models trained on simulation data with real data.

(implement new table in MariaDB's information schema, and can use SQL command to get the information)</li>\n<li>provide an introspection feature that can inspect the word's info and some real data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And this project autocompletion feature is based on mycli's autocompletion engine. Then do some enhancement on that. Such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Database suggestion before 「.」. Ex: 「insert into db_name_to_be_completed.table_name\nVALUES\n(...) 」</li>\n<li>add global and session variable suggestions</li>\n<li>can suggest system default database, table, column. Ex: add column suggest for system table like mysql.user.</li>\n<li>Autocompletion about database_name.table_name_to_be_completed could suggest the table, which not in the currently selected database</li>\n<li>fix some bugs related to the word of the user is the column name and also is the keyword</li>\n</ol>\n",

By integrating a membrane curvature analysis module in MDAnalysis, users will benefit from a tool that enables rapid extraction of relevant properties of lipid bilayers in biomolecular systems. Our approach extracts key elements of the membrane using phospholipid head groups to define a surface, followed by a transformation into NumPy arrays. In this way, the functionality offered by NumPy and SciPy can be used to derive values of mean and gaussian curvature of biological membranes.

          "description": "<p>MDanalysis (MDA) is a powerful open-source package for exploring and performing calculations on molecular dynamics trajectories. Despite MDAs broad utility, especially for biomolecular simulations, it does not implement many common operations for studying ion solvation. I propose adding a robust and cohesive set of methods for solvation analysis that would be widely useful in both biomolecular and battery electrolyte simulations. The core of the solvation module will be a cohesive set of functions for easily working with ionic solvation shells. Using that core functionality, I will implement several analysis methods for analyzing ion pairing, ion speciation, residence times, and shell association and dissociation.</p>\n",

WebAssembly has become prominent in recent years as it can port C++ applications onto web browsers, making code more portable and utilizing the efficiencies of C++. In my GSoC internship, I will combine MediaPipe and WebAssembly by building an open-source realtime web video effects app. I will create a complete workflow of wrapping models in MediaPipe to be used in a webapp for running different ML-based video effects live in the browser using WebAssembly. The workflow will include wrapping the model binaries in calculators, create calculator graphs to use the model binaries, set up Bazel for WebAssembly compilation, write Emscripten bindings to access the models, and create a Typescript webapp to demonstrate how to access the WebAssembly binaries in realtime. I have extensive experience in C++ development, along with web development using Javascript. I have also been using MediaPipe for almost a year and am accustomed to the codebase.

In an ideal case a module writer would want the APIs to take the same parameters, return the same results and fail on the same conditions.</p>\n<h4>Fix localization Issues</h4>\n<p>If the session is from an OS of different language, there can be some issues where the module might break because of wrong output strings received in the process of post exploitation. This part fixes those kind of bugs.</p>\n<h4>Enhancements for powershell sessions</h4>\n<p>As a scripting language, PowerShell is commonly used for automating the management of systems and can be a treasure for the attackers if present on the target system because of it's rich functionality. But at most places in the POST APIs powershell session type was not supported and was depended upon OS specific commands for operations. This project adds the use of powershell cmdlets for all the post exploitation methods.</p>\n",

This project improves the following aspects of the animation portion of MIT App Inventor.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enabling users to choose a custom origin for image sprites using a drag-able marker. The origin of a sprite is the root of the sprite's coordinate system. All of the interactions of the sprite that may include collisions, positioning etc. is with respect to the origin. This project implements the desired functionality of custom origin in the appinventor system and adds an interactive way, via a drag-able marker, for selecting this origin easily.  </li>\n<li>Improving the algorithm used to detect collisions among sprites. Right now appinventor uses a naive algorithm to detect collisions between sprites. This collision detection does not work correctly for rotated image sprites and they are treated as if they were unrotated. This projects implements the SAT collision detection algorithm that replaces the naive implementation. This helps detect collisions in rotated image sprites and is more extensible.</li>\n</ol>\n",

The information in an SBML model file is organized as a list of components encapsulated within the model (e.g. compartments, species, parameters, reactions, etc.). However, SBML is difficult to read, comprehend and interpret by humans directly, and tools are required to provide an abstraction layer to interact with SBML objects and the relationships between them. The objective of the project SBML4Humans is to address this issue by providing  an interactive and reactive report for SBML models which will allow humans (experts as well as beginners) to easily comprehend the content of a model. The key features introduced in the interactive report are:</p>\n<p>i) interactive SBML report with navigation between SBML objects</p>\n<p>ii) search and filter functionality</p>\n<p>iii) web application with REST API</p>\n<p>iv) downloadable standalone reports</p>\n<p>v) support for hierarchical models</p>\n<p>vi) support for distributions and uncertainties</p>\n<p>vii) support for COMBINE archives</p>\n<p>Such an interactive report will thus significantly enhance the process of reading and exchanging SBML models.</p>\n",

CD models involve the analysis of flows from an origin to a destination similarly to traditional SI models, however, CD includes the ‘Competing Destination’ term also known as ‘Accessibility’ term, which accounts for the spatial-structure effect of the flows from behavioural perspective.\nAlthough the SI models are established within Python and R modules already (SpInt, simR),  specification for deriving Accessibility term for CD estimation is missing. \nThis project aims to fill this gap by developing a Competing Destination class that will include the computation of the accessibility term and will be binded to the existing SpInt module. The main challenge here is the scaling of the accessibility computation for large datasets. This is an important aspect of the project as flow datasets often have hundred thousands and even millions records.\nThis project will extend the use of the SpInt module and PySAL library for high level analysis of spatial flows.</p>\n",

We start by solving the Held-Karp relaxation using the Ascent method from the original paper by Held and Karp. Assuming the result is fractional, we continue into the Asadpour algorithm (integral solutions are optimal by definition and immediately returned). We approximate the distribution of spanning trees on the undirected support of the Held Karp solution using a maximum entropy rounding method to construct a distribution of trees. Roughly speaking, the probability of sampling any given tree is proportional to the product of all its edge lambda values. We sample 2 log <em>n</em> trees from the distribution using an iterative approach developed by V. G. Kulkarni and choose the tree with the smallest cost after returning direction to the arcs. Finally, the minimum tree is augmented using a minimum network flow algorithm and shortcut down to an <em>O(log n / log log n)</em> approximation of the minimum Hamiltonian cycle.</p>\n",

According to the retriever docs, currently the retriever library uses the PostGIS extension for the same. Therefore, the install process to be used for the dashboard will make use of the postgres engine. The spatial datasets are already tested for only download and changes are detected using the md5 hash. This proposal will further that, into proper install of these datasets into Postgres and find out diffs in the databases using PostGIS joins. The results obtained will then be converted into HTML diffs just like we do for non-spatial databases.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Real-world data generating processes often don't produce normally-distributed data, in particular the skewness/kurtosis/tail index parameters are inconsistent with a Gaussian random variable. If we can \"Gaussianize\" data from such processes in a meaningful way, then we can make better inferences.  We can solve this problem generally by applying a Lambert W transform (Goerg, 2014), which assumes the observed data is distributed as Lambert W x F_X, where F_X is the distribution of the latent input (Goerg , 2011). To apply this transform, we need to estimate parameters of the Lambert W x F_X distribution and also support the inverse transform, so that we can make inferences about the latent input. With this project, we want to support Lambert W x F_X distribution in Stan in an inferential setting, which means: users can build Gaussian models over non-normal data in a transparent way.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>In the last several years, deep learning became widely used in various different fields, ranging from object detection and face recognition to speech recognition and machine translation. The common thing between all these areas is that they are working on structured data - data that can be represented in a table, such as images with a well defined number of rows and columns. An example of unstructured data are graphs - a collections of nodes connected with edges. Although graphs can also be represented through adjacency matrix, this representation implies ordinality of the nodes. Furthermore, once trained on a graph represented this way, a neural network could be used only on the graphs of the same sizes. This was fixed with the introduction of graph neural networks.</p>\n<p>In this project, I will construct models based on graph neural networks and apply them to graphs found in the Reactome database. Reactome is a graph database of pathways of several organisms. The goal is to create a Python client able to compute the vector representations of the pathways, which may be used in downstream analysis such as predicting whether a pathway is involved within a certain disease.</p>\n",

Even though the current implementation can compute high-temperature spectra of millions of lines in just a few seconds it is quite memory hungry. In order to be able to run computations on high-temperature infrared spectra from databases of tens of millions of lines, it is essential to optimize memory consumption in a way that it is possible for us to run reasonably large data on a regular machine (one that has 8 - 16 GB of RAM). RADIS uses Pandas dataframe for handling all the databases currently. Pandas rule of thumb: have 5 to 10 times as much RAM as the size of the dataset. Which makes it impossible to read say a database of size 5GB on a machine with a RAM of 16GB.

This capability enables web developers to create intelligent usages, like image classification, object detection, segmentation and style transfer, with rich web contents, like images, videos and camera streams. Although OpenCV.js dnn module is using WebAssembly with multi-threading and SIMD128 optimization, there still exists a huge gap between OpenCV.js and OpenCV native. This is because OpenCV native can leverage more advanced hardware features and even ML-specific accelerators via native instructions and ML APIs. Web Neural Network API (WebNN) is an emerging web standard that allows web apps to access the AI hardware accelerations. It can get near-native performance on a variety of Intel-based platforms through the open source module oneDNN. Thus, in this proposal, I illustrate my idea about how to integrate WebNN into OpenCV.js and accelerate dnn module.</p>\n",

The software uses its own database schema which differs from the one used by the main OSM database. As a result, Nominatim processes OSM data in a way that allows to discover a lot of inconsistencies. The idea of the project is to build a Quality Assurance tool which will analyze the Nominatim database and extract the data errors to multiple formatted JSON files. The errors will be extracted based on a set of rules defined inside the tool. At first, the exported JSON files would be used to present all the errors data to OSM mappers through a visual map on a website. Thus, this tool will help OSM mappers to correct wrong data by taking advantage of the Nominatim internal data structure. The tool should be designed in a way that allows to add new rules easily. In the future, it should also be possible to extract the reports in some other formats in a flexible way. The process would be run once per day against the Nominatim database, stopping regular updates during its execution, so it is crucial that it is optimized to run fast.</p>\n",

That is, to add more features, including customization of orientation, animation, font, opacity. Support right-click to switch the input source or open the tray menu, scroll to switch among pages or candidates, fix candidate box and IME switch list order,  ASCII mode auto-switch, reposition, show or hide candidate box page buttons, set system tray settings, input source indicator with settings. Theme and background picture follow GNOME Night Light Mode, and so on. These customizations will make users find IBus in GNOME familiar if they have just switched from another platform. Eventually, an extension providing full customization of appearance, behavior, system tray, input source indicator for IBus will be available.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/IBus-Customize\" target=\"_blank\">Archived Codebase</a></h4>\n",

          "description": "<p>This proposal fulfills the need for continued development of the Swift Processing code base. This means that bugs would be fixed and more user-friendly abstractions of Apple's API would be added. Swift means that Apple's hardware can be leveraged like the camera, sensors, and GPU. This creates opportunities to support Metal (Apple's graphics API) within Swift Processing or OpenGL ES, as is the case with Processing.  AR Kit, Apple's augmented reality API, is another possible item that might be included. I am a computational artist and designer as well as an iOS developer. I have taught Creative Coding to a very diverse student body at the community college level since 2015 and with Swift since 2018 using various frameworks. For this I've \"flipped\" courses and built out asynchronous online courses with videos and tutorials. My experience teaching Swift has given me insight into what makes an API and its examples/tutorials successful. Swift creates unique challenges for new learners. Being involved in this project would allow me to contribute in a way that makes a difference and makes Swift more inclusive and accessible to the creative coding community.</p>\n",

It has been used by CERN in its ROOT project and an R interface called Runuran also exists. It will be a very nice addition to scipy.stats. The default method used by SciPy to sample from any distribution requires integrating the PDF and then numerically inverting the CDF. The implementation in SciPy is too slow to be relied on for practical purposes and custom methods for sampling random variates need to be implemented for the distributions in SciPy. In contrast UNU.RAN offers several methods (e.g. TDR, PINV) that offer very good performance to sample from wide classes of distributions.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to provide an object-oriented interface for methods present in UNU.RAN to sample from univariate continuous and discrete distributions using NumPy’s BitGenerator as the Uniform Random Number Sampler (URNG). My proposal also includes writing a comprehensive test and documentation suite with tutorials. If time permits, I also propose to write benchmarks for the added methods.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Intracranial electrophysiology is commonly recorded during and after invasive brain surgeries in epilepsy patients to determine where seizure activity starts. These recordings are also used to learn about normal brain function under various experimental conditions. The first step in analyzing intracranial electrophysiology recordings is determining the location of the electrode contacts in the coordinate frame of a subject’s T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI). The subject must also have a computed tomography (CT) image taken during or after the implantation surgery. The pre-surgical MRI has better resolution of the brain anatomy than the CT, whereas the CT shows the positions of the electrode contacts. These two 3D images allow the location of the electrode contacts to be associated with anatomical brain structures. MNE-Python has existing tools for analyzing time series data recorded by intracranial electrode contacts but there is a gap in the functionality in being able to label the location of intracranial electrode contacts. The proposed project is to add a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to localize electrode contacts as an enhancement to MNE-Python.</p>\n",

I want to upgrade it to a parallelized algorithm to process multiple frames in a batch and increase the processing speed exponentially, which will also help in faster testing of hyperparameters.

This requires from us to have better understanding how videos are constructed. Videos are constructed by combining different shots of the camera placed after each other. A combination of different shot transition creates the final video at the end. The final video contain visual effects which could be classified into two main categories: sharp and gradual. The former is a sudden change of the shot over 1 frame, while gradual transitions occur over multiple frames. Gradual transitions are further classified into dissolve and non-dissolve. The former includes cases such as semi-transparent graduals, fade in and fade out. Non-dissolve are dominated by wipes. Wipe graduals have a much wider variety than the dissolve graduals.</p>\n",

The research task is to detect hand gestures in raw news videos which are streams of RGB images.  I propose a Transformer and keypoints-based pose tracking system and a Transformer and keypoints-based gesture detector to fulfill this task. This structure is composed of a keypoints extractor, a person tracker, and a gesture detector. The mission has three main parts, the first part is to track people in temporal space. In the second part, for each person, we use their hand keypoints features in temporal space to construct several keypoints sequences. The third part is to use these sequences to make predictions of the existence of gestures. I believe that for gesture detection tasks, both spatial and temporal information is important. So that is why we use the Transformer which can take into account the local information of hand keypoints in one frame to capture the shape information and it values also the relationship of keypoints in different frames that is the global information refer to the motion.</p>\n",

This project is a predator-prey agent-based modeling attempt to simulate an ecological setup consisting of vervet monkeys as they interact with predators and give alarm calls.

However, those features are biased. Indeed, during the loading of the new binary, Rizin uses various information that aren't relevant as default loading data. For example, Rizin loads sections information at the start. But it is common knowledge that section information can be manipulated without modifying the program execution. With this issue comes the fact that Rizin uses section information to deduct imported functions, strings and for other various analyses. Therefore, we need to make the section loading optional. The second problem is how Rizin loads PLT data. Currently, the PLT is linked to the GOT using hard coded values, which should be replaced by a dynamic analysis like in Ghidra.</p>\n",

After completing this project, users would be able to get information about the state of the heap in Cutter and do this for cases of remote debugging and a variety of allocators. \nAs part of the project, the following are the key features that will be added and changed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Widgets in Cutter for the following:</li>\n<li>Bins Info (Fastbins, Unsorted, Small, Large)</li>\n<li>T-cache Info for each thread</li>\n<li>Arenas Info (chunks, top, last remainder)</li>\n<li>Graph visualization for bins and tcache</li>\n<li>Improve the implementation of heap related commands like <code>dmh</code> in Rizin</li>\n<li>Refactor the Rizin code to make heap parsing work for non-native code</li>\n<li>Add heap parsing for other allocators like MacHeap.</li>\n</ul>\n",

          "description": "<p>With the advent of Machine Learning, one can learn such heuristics and use them as cost functions in conventional path planners. SNGNN-1D is one such Graph Neural Network based Machine Learning algorithm which evaluates the static scenes generated randomly from the point of view of the robot. In short, it outputs a score between 0-100 which shows how good the robot’s position is with respect to its surroundings. This score, for every state in the room, is used to generate a heat map that is used by A* algorithm to plan a path to the goal position. The problem with this implementation is that it is computationally expensive and is relatively slow, also SNGNN has been trained using static scenes and does not factor in dynamic settings for example, walking humans, which is a very common scenario in a social setting. A more cost effective way to carry out this task would be to train a policy to reach the goal. However, it is difficult to structure a reward function for complex environments. In such cases, Reinforcement Learning is a promising pursuit that can make use of SNGNN-1D as a reward function because it scores the robot’s presence in the room with respect to its surroundings.</p>\n",

In practice, previous maps and laser values are combined to create a list of convexified obstacle-free regions.

          "description": "<p>Rocket.Chat has a remarkable internationalization effort. There are dozens of translation files across several apps, many of them with over 4000 translation strings. However, there's still a long way to go - some strings still lack translation, others need to be removed, etc. Currently, the translation process is entirely manual, making it even harder to manage that much information. To speed up the internationalization process, our goal is to build a tool that makes translators live's easier. We want to create a CLI app that helps in the translation process, answering questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which strings weren't translated yet? </li>\n<li>Which strings are not mentioned in the codebase anymore? </li>\n<li>What is the translation progress for a given language?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to make the actual translating easier, providing an interactive interface to add or remove translations. Our goal is to raise Rocket.Chat's translation standards - to ensure these standards are met, we'll build a CI scripts that checks for translation string usage in new contributions, ensuring every new translation string added to the codebase is listed in the translation files.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>An asymptotic expression typically contains exact terms and O-terms, for example n3 + 2n2 + O(n). The basic framework for this asymptotic ring is already implemented. The main aim of this summer of code project is to extend its functionality up to the point where asymptotic expressions with explicit constants are fully supported. In his book, “Asymptotic Methods in Analysis” on page 5, deBruijn calls it an “L-term”, but we will call it “B-term”. B_{20}(3z) is a B-term, which stands for an expression which is bounded in absolute value by\n3|z| for |z| ≥ 20. Sometimes, in research, it is important to know from which values of the variable on the asymptotic expression has enough precision to decide wether it is larger than a given bound. This cannot be achieved by O-terms (because the unknown implicit constant might be very large). For example, the average number of comparisons of classical quicksort is 2n log n + O(n). When comparing with recent variants, such as dual pivot quicksort with average number of comparisons 1.8n log n + O(n), it is interesting to know how large the O-terms are in order to know when dual-pivot quicksort will be more efficient than classical quicksort.</p>\n",

It turns out to be practical to denote it as an infinite series, although it does no longer represent a function.  However, the usual operations on power series, such as addition and multiplication, can be given combinatorial meaning, which makes them an indispensable tool in discrete mathematics. Lazy Formal Power Series are an implementation of the Formal Power Series for a computer where coefficients are only computed on-demand, to deal with the problem that we can store only a finite amount of information.\nSageMath has an implementation of the Lazy Formal Power Series in the combinatorial species code. The project aims to disentangle the code from the unrequired submodules and create a robust structure. Another aim of the project is to implement Puiseux Series and bring in the implementation of the Laurent Series code into the same module. There are also bugs in the code that computes the coefficients of series which are defined implicitly by a system of functional equations.  Fixing these is another milestone.

Finally, we aim to implement computation of the dynatomic cycle, which gives equations defining the minimal preperiodic points, as well as Stoll's reduction algorithm for zero dimensional varieties, which computes reduced equations defining a given variety.</p>\n",

As such there is considerable interest in implementing computational methods to understand these objects, with packages with various levels of utility and accuracy exists in multiple Computer Algebra Systems (CASs), and a meeting with active members of the community demonstrated an appetite and need for a centralised CAS with which to complete calculations. Sage is, we believe,  the best candidate. This project would then build upon the existing work of Nils Bruin to implement and improve the necessary backend tools for such a system, before proceeding to utilise these to create a method for the Abel-Jacobi map, an important object in the study of Riemann surfaces.</p>\n",

Scala is one of the leading languages in implementation of big data systems. It is widely used in streaming data. Similarly, Python has become the language of choice for data scientists with its many high-quality scientific libraries. ScalaPy is that bridge which gives an opportunity to use Python libraries in Scala. Last year a new version of Scala was introduced. At the moment it is not released but Scala 3 brings many new features and changes. The aim of this project is to discover those new features and implement support for ScalaPy in Scala 3. ScalaPy will possibly help Scala 3 to become more popular among scientists and maybe this will be the core moment in combining data processing and data analysis worlds in Scala 3.</p>\n",

If we want to extract all the data from their phones and see which of them are actually involved in the crime scene then we require software to perform this task and produce Meaningful evidence and Analysis reports for every phone (Digital forensic case).</p>\n<p>From Google Summer of Code 2021, OpenMF will be able to extract data of SMS(text messages), Browser history, Bluetooth data, EXIF data from images, Location history along with General information of the device, Call logs, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Contacts data(already exists). Data can be extracted from CMD as well as using API(POSTMAN) or from Frontend also. APIs were created to fetch data where ever required. Also, OpenMF is now able for showing analytics and relate data of cases using graphs, maps, and Tables which come in Data Visualization.</p>\n",

OSS licenses can be detected automatically by comparing the license document with templates of major OSS licenses managed by SPDX using a string algorithm.

To make up for this deficiency, this project is to develop a new parser type, here I call it <strong>regexp-parser()</strong>. The motivation behind <strong>regexp-parser()</strong> is to remove the need to use filters to extract name-value pairs from content, which has traditionally been done by parsers.

Beyond introduction of JIT to SQL subsystem there are multiple smaller improvements which might be developed for SQL virtual machine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>merge CHECKs bytecode into a monolithic program;</li>\n<li>add VDBE assembler;</li>\n<li>use threaded interpretation.\nThe easiest approach in its implementation is 'threaded-code'. Threaded code is a programming technique where the code has a form that essentially consists entirely of calls to subroutines. It is often used in compilers, which may generate code in that form or be implemented in that form themselves. The code may be processed by an interpreter or it may simply be a sequence of machine code call instructions.\nAnother optimization is instruction merging: a sequence of opcodes is replaced by a single mega opcode. There is a proposal to create a single VDBE running all the CHECK constraints.</li>\n</ul>\n",

A static query hint is nice because it gives the user more control over the split points and data partitioning, but it would be nice to have the option to run a query without having to process the data and its split points in advance. Within the last year, code was added to Asterix that implemented a spatial join with a dynamic range hint. This code can pick split points (or tiles) before the join.

Today, rolling out a new model has become ever easier with the popularization of open-source frameworks such as scikit-learn and MLJ. Despite the unprecedented accessibility, designing effective models with appropriate hyperparameters remains obscure for the common user without high-level technical understanding and expert intuition. In an effort to automate the process of tweaking hyperparameters, MLJ has introduced a unified interface for tuning models, providing support for widely used strategies like grid and random search. The available schemes, however, primarily perform exhaustive testings on selected hyperparameter combinations. In this proposal, I present a plan to implement a new strategy, particle swarm optimization (PSO), which utilizes information from past attempts to improve hyperparameter search. The first section offers a summary of the method and existing implementations, while the second sketches the technical details of a PSO algorithm for MLJ and a tentative timeline to deliver the project’s goals.</p>\n",

This enables performant, standardized graph  algorithms which are easily differentiable by modern auto-diff tools. In this JSOC 2021 project I aim to provide automatic differentiation rules for all of the operations in the GraphBLAS C API which admit such rules. The SuiteSparse GraphBLAS (SS:GrB) implementation will be the primary target, and support for the several extensions to the specification in SS:GrB is also a goal. The primary application I am pursuing is an efficient implementation of graph machine learning in Julia, but it should be noted that graph computation and generalized sparse linear algebra have incredibly broad use cases including graph algorithms like breadth first search, and faster neural networks by taking advantage of sparsity and operators faster than typical multiplication.</p>\n",

Specifically, we intend to extend the packages Fairness.jl and MLJ.jl to include methods that implement counterfactual fairness, a recent definition of fairness.

          "description": "<p>To realise the full potential of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs), it is essential to automate the inference of latent variables in the model, conditioned on the observed data. Hence PPLs usually come with built-in algorithms to perform Bayesian inference on such models automatically. However, due to the expressiveness of PPLs, it is very challenging to design general purpose inference algorithms for models specified in Turing-complete PPLs. Applications tend to build their own custom inference machines, which is time consuming and labour intensive. \nThis proposal puts forward a recently introduced framework—the involutive Markov chain Monte Carlo (iMCMC), as a candidate for inference in a PPL, namely Turing. Such a framework would enable the automation of an implementation of a correct inference algorithm from user specifications in Turing. Moreover, Turing readily supports differentiable programming (in their HMC implementation) which is the main technical requirement of iMCMC. Early iMCMC developments in Gen show promising results compared to standard black box styled inferences. Hence, it would be desirable to have an implementation in Turing.</p>\n",

This tool was initially released for Linux developers who send patches on mailing lists, but it can also be applied to other projects. To describe matching and transformation rules in the source code with a patch-like appearance, Coccinelle employs a domain specific language called the Semantic Patch Language (SmPL), and attempts to manipulate the given C code based on the given SmPL rule.  Although SmPL can provide many useful matching and transformation features, there are limits to the C matching patterns that the SmPL grammar can express due to the complexity of the C grammar. This is particularly the case for function headers, that involve complex types, annotations, etc that have been somewhat less tested by the users of Coccinelle. This project will study the current status and limitations of the handleability of function headers by designing and running a script that checks whether each function header in a given project can be parsed correctly and applying it to the latest Linux kernel.

LLVM IR is an SSA-based intermediate representation whose design helps in the easy and efficient implementation of various compiler optimizations and transformations. \nAlive2 is a tool that checks whether the transformation of an instruction set into another instruction set is semantically correct or not. It is a verification framework for LLVM IR, which checks whether the source and target IR are equivalent or disproves by providing a counterexample. Alive2 can reason about a wide variety of intraprocedural optimization problems, including control flow, memory, vectors, and floating-point. Alive2 has detected some fundamental issues in the LLVM-IR, which lead to mis-compilation and unsound optimizations.

One way to speed up running of the tests could be to distribute test execution across many computers too.

It is difficult to determine whether an optimization is correct because bugs occur in corner cases and it’s hard to test them all for each optimization. But, thanks to Alive2, we can formally check the correctness of optimizations. Many of the bugs found are related to the notion of undef and poison values in LLVM. The semantics of these values has been formalized recently, and existing optimizations are being fixed to match the semantics. For example, branching on undef is now defined as undefined behavior (UB), and several branch-related optimizations are being fixed. However, fixing some of the optimizations requires further work, mainly due to performance concerns. One representative example is loop unswitch: it is incorrect, but still unfixed because fixing it causes big regressions in some benchmarks. Our goal is to fix such miscompilations with minimal-to-no performance regression. This project will investigate what is necessary to recover slowdowns and upstream the patches to LLVM.</p>\n",

Enzyme is made as a plugin of LLVM and synthesizes differentiated functions directly on optimized LLVM IR code, which provides it with advantages in efficiency and universality. From another aspect, Rust is an emerging high-performance and safe language. Many of its users are trying to bring machine learning to it, thus an high-performance and user-friendly AD tool needed. Enzyme is a good option for this demand. However, without a deep integration into Rust, Enzyme's user experience with Rust is not so good, and more importantly, it may suffer from performance reduction due to wasted Rust meta-information.

As the app is being targeted to a broad audience so we need to support more language for great user experience and engagement.

Users will be allowed to easily switch the language of their choice during Signup or Login. Users will also have the capability to change the language inside the app. Talawa app aims to build a strong and meaningful relationship among the members of the organizations with the help of features like group chats, news feed and events. Therefore making sure of effective communication between people of different language is also necessary. Modification in the backend will be done accordingly to help different language users to communicate effectively in groups.

Consider the clinical trial design as an example. Optimizing the clinical trial design is essential to decrease the cost of drug development, as the average costs are up to 52.9 million US dollars for a Phase 3 trial [1]. The current approach formulates multi-stage decision-making as a general Linear Programming (LP) problem, which however, is computationally expensive especially in large-scale settings. In this project, we aim to develop new customized algorithms and an R package for multi-stage decision-making problems with three key features: 1) It provides a highly efficient solver to tackle a large and important class of sparse LP problems; 2) It provides a solution for multi-stage decision-making problems with Bayes risk constraints; 3) It provides additional functions such as visualization of the optimal decision maps.</p>\n",

The package performs multivariate output analysis on extremely high dimensional Markov chains of the order of a thousand components and lengths exceeding millions, experiencing bottlenecks in efficiency. The primary goal of the project is to systematically identify and clear efficiency bottlenecks via detailed benchmarking and testings. This project will focus on improving the implementation of critical subroutines, like batchsize() and mcse.q(), of the package. This would involve migrating to Rcpp, parallel implementation of functions and implementing alternate algorithms for the task. In addition, improvements to the existing implementation by correcting for numerical instabilities, Rcpp sugar implementations, solving for error or warning messages in corner cases, updating documentation and developing a class identifiable with the output form an integral part of the project. A list of additional tasks specific to certain functions will also work towards improving efficiency and accuracy of the package.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>When dealing with time series, sometimes the trend in a signal seems to suddenly change at certain points. In many disciplines it is important to identify these changepoints in order to obtain useful information about the dataset. There are several techniques designed to accomplish this task. Among them, Binary Segmentation is an algorithm that computes changepoints in linearithmic time. Although the predicted changepoints are approximated, it is widely used since it is fast and efficient even for large datasets.</p>\n<p>The aim of this project is to create a new package that implements the Binary Segmentation algorithm with support for several distributions and types of change. The algorithm was implemented in C++, by using an Object Oriented approach to create an easily extensible structure, and it was integrated with R via <em>Rcpp</em>. This will be useful for usRs with large datasets who want to obtain a quick segmentation model.</p>\n",

It then tackles the problem mentioned above by introducing currencies and improving the inventory a player spawns with to allow for more defensive structures to be built and additional weapons/traps to be used along with various effects to help change the pace of the game.

Unfortunately, during my internship at ISP RAS my colleague Vitaly Cheptsov and I identified multiple defects in the current implementation of the EDK II PE/COFF loader. In consequence, I was tasked with implementing a more robust version of the library, ensuring reliability and security using formal methods. After the internship has concluded and our new loader has proven to be functional in many real-world scenarios, it is time to integrate it into the EDK II core, to increase the overall level of the firmware's reliability and security. The surrounding ecosystem should follow to take full advantage of the new code, including application of stricter memory permissions.</p>\n",

The ease of use of its forerunning product, VLC Media Player, has made it the number one choice for millions of users around the world for viewing and interacting with media. Yet, despite this VLC Media Player’s design is relatively outdated. Features should be readily obvious to users, not hidden in multiple menus so that they can be accessed quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>As an avid VLC Media Player fan, this forms the motivation behind my proposal. I propose to update VLC Media Player by leveraging Qt/QML to design a more modern and elegant interface. Specifically, I plan to redesign and implement a new welcome screen which is visible upon first opening of VLC Media Player.

Owing to the powerful functionalities that user scripts provide, one should easily get started with them. <strong>Guided Adventure Tours</strong> is one such medium that can enable amateur developers and users with a little bit of JavaScript knowledge to learn about them in an interactive way.</p>\n<p>This project is about creating a UserScript/Gadget guided tour to facilitate users to learn about user scripts and how they are created using fundamental constructs such as MediaWiki JS Module, MediaWiki Action API, and OOUI, sequentially.</p>\n",

This auto-completion will support all the pages that match a specific category, Cargo field, SMW property, or SMW concept. This autocompletion will be implemented with WikiMedia's OOUI which will help in maintaining consistency across all other extensions too.</p>\n",

There are two types of installations currently present for XWiki - Testing one and Production one. Also, there are two major versions available currently: 12.10.5 - the stable release and 13.2 - the active latest release. Cloud computing has gained significant recognition in the past few years due to the availability of a virtually unlimited number of servers and unlimited power/memory availability within seconds while maintaining a pay-per-use model for billing. As companies and users move to Cloud-based solutions for their server needs, it makes sense that XWiki too should integrate seamlessly with major cloud provider solutions. Currently, Amazon’s AWS has the greatest market share in the Cloud Market, which is greater than the combined market share of Google (GCP) and Microsoft (Azure). Therefore we need to provide AMIs and Cloudformation Templates (in the context of AWS), which end users can consume directly to spin up XWiki within minutes and start testing/working.</p>\n",
