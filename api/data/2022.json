While GIMP is primarily focused on digital editing, their backend systems and libraries are more than capable of CMYK workflows.\n\nThe goal of this project is to enable users to begin using GIMP for creating images for print. A basic implementation consists of three milestones:\n\n1) Allowing users to import and export the most common \"print\" file formats (.tiff, .pdf/.eps/.ai, .psd) with CMYK profiles.\n\n2) Developing a Dockable Dialogue to simplify the process of changing profiles, enabling soft-proofing, and other related tools.\n\n3) Identifying and improving existing issues with Color Management as part of GIMP's Color Space Invasion initiative.\n\nWhile this basic implementation would not fully implement the \"High-end CMYK support\" goal in GIMP's roadmap, it would be a step in that direction, and could encourage users and developers to contribute further to that effort.",

If we want to do it in a systematic and data-driven way we can use benchmarking, which allows to measure how impactful and useful the change or configuration update is.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a benchmarking framework that would allow for frictionless assessment of the quality of the security analyzer before it reaches the production environment.

          "description": "AF_XDP is an address family that is optimized for high performance packet processing. AF_XDP redirects raw network packets to user mode through the XDP program. AF_XDP, like DPDK, can be used to bypass the Linux kernel to gain high-performance processing network packets.  DNSDist acts as a load balancer and often needs to process and forward packets. Therefore, in order to forward DNS requests DNSDist needs the raw network packets processed by the Linux kernel network protocol stack, read its request, and send the same request to the downstream DNS server again through the Linux kernel network protocol stack. The repeated processing of the same or similar data by the Linux kernel network stack is an unnecessary overhead for the server deploying DNSDist.

          "description": "The international Belle II collaboration handles huge amounts of data from the Belle II detector, relying on custom software for simulation, reconstruction,\nvisualization, and analysis. This software, developed over the past decade by hundreds of physicists, is constantly evolving to optimize the algorithms for better physics performance and resource efficiency. \n\nGiven the size, diversity and dynamic nature of the development team, quality assurance of the software is a big challenge. Belle II Software has had several monitoring schemes implemented so far, along with a high-level validation tool. This tool runs on existing large datasets producing distribution plots of quantities relevant for physics analyses and displaying the results on a webpage. This project aims to improve this validation tool. Bookkeeping of known issues detected by the tool, along with improved logging and integration with the issue tracking system can help fast track root cause analyses. The plots generated can also display more relevant information, and point toward the datasets used to encourage the reuse of common artefacts. \n\nThe plan is to enhance the user experience of the Belle II software validation tool and make workflows more efficient with appropriate technical solutions. We will start with integrating the issue tracking system with the validation tool, to better track the history of degradations. The plotting module will be overhauled to include relevant software information, as well as hyperlinks to make them self-sufficient. Enhancements to the logging module to have better logs attached directly to the issues from the validation tool to fast track issue debugging. The common artefacts will be pooled together in a manner allowing for easy reference from plots, logs and issues and also to prevent regeneration overheads. All the changes will be integrated with the production code, after rigorous testing, along with detailed documentation.",

This will give the user the same User Interface as clad for writing his/her code, but the option of using Enzyme as the backend with all its optimisations to calculate the Derivative/Gradient of the requested function.

The Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) have achieved similar performance as the full Monte Carlo based simulation, but with reduced time taken. As quantum computers promise many advantages over classical computing, comes a question on whether quantum machine learning (QML) can give any improvement in solving the problem. This project aims to demonstrate quantum machine learning's potential, specifically Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN), in HEP events data generation and classification from image data.

I train the quantum autoencoder on standard model data and compare it's performance as an anomaly tagger to a classical autoencoder, to study the potential use of quantum machine learning methods to enhance HEP analyses.",

          "description": "In recent years, the convolutional neural network has been successfully applied in particle physics identification tasks. Despite its great success, the existing image-based methods for particle suffers from data sparsity. Motivated by this question, we plan to represent the particles data in graph and find the most suitable graph representation method in this project. Then, we will build various graph neural networks for end-to-end tau identification with the cutting-edge methods in current graph deep learning research. Furthermore, we will analyze the model performance from multiple perspectives and try to interpret what the networks have learned through training. Lastly, we will benchmark model inference on GPU and provide user guidance through documentation and code. This project will give some insights into the application of Graph Neural Network in tau particle identification and is expected to help the ML4SCI community conduct research in future work.",

The problem can be mitigated by using Equivariant Transformers. Attention layers can directly replace the convolutions, so they will be able to attend to a larger receptive field than regular convolutions. In addition, the equivariant part of the model can replace the manual augmentation applied on every batch during training.",

          "description": "The 2010s decade marked a beginning for widespread compiler testing with the release of programs like Csmith, a C program generator that since its release has found and reported over 400 compiler bugs. However, as highlighted by a recent study, the research on compiler testing has critically neglected the front-end component of compilers, leaving unfound bugs in the type checking procedure of compilers. More specifically, this could lead to the compilers of statically-typed languages, which utilize features such as type inference, both accepting erroneous programs and rejecting correct ones.\nHephaestus is a tool designed to test the compilers of three languages, namely Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. It has already successfully detected over 150 bugs in the compilers of these languages. I propose a way to extend Hephaestus for it to be able to successfully test and detect bugs in the compiler of TypeScript. This can be a great contribution to the user-base and community of TypeScript, a language that has risen in popularity and usage in the past years.\nHephaestus detects bugs by:\n1.\tgenerating semantically-valid programs that (a) utilize parametric polymorphism and (b) are abstract\n2.\tgenerating these programs in an intermediate representation (IR), an OOP language that supports parametric polymorphism and type inference\n3.\tusing translators to convert the abstract IR program to the desired language.",

Therefore, Apothesis can be a valuable tool for scientists and engineers working in this field. \nHowever, Apothesis’ applicability to many problems and popularity is severely limited by the settings (species growth/deposition geometries, processes) that can be specified by the user and the very specific input format (JSON format) that is not widely used in the scientific community.

During the last GSoC, an API system was developed, so that using Blockly is expected to be easy. So, I would love to connect both the compact version and the full one with Scratch/Blockly following ELLAK ‘s aesthetics, like this existing prototype. The app should be colourful and have an interactive design, specially designed for students, also having multiple pop ups and information about their actions and whether they were successful or not. I would like to turn programming into a fun activity, so that the children can learn while having fun.\nHowever, since Blockly’s integration requires modifying the core library, I plan on rewriting some parts of the Raspberry Pi’s code  concerning movement control.

          "description": "Object detection has made great progress in the past few years along with the development of deep learning. However, most current object detection methods are resource hungry, which hinders their wide deployment to many resource-restricted usages such as usages on always-on devices, battery-powered low-end devices, etc. This project would aim to propose the use of tiny-DSOD for resource-restricted usage. This considers the resource and accuracy trade-off for resource-restricted usages during designing the whole object detection framework. Based on the deeply supervised object detection (DSOD) framework. Tiny-DSOD introduces two innovative and ultra-efficient architecture blocks: depthwise dense block (DDB) based backbone and depthwise feature-pyramid-network (D-FPN) based front-end. We conduct extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark and compare Tiny-DSOD to the state-of-the-art ultra-efficient object detection solutions such as Tiny-YOLO, MobileNet-SSD (v1 & v2), SqueezeDet, Pelee, and Faster-RCNN.",

          "description": "Deep learning is now used to solve many different CV problems. A typical approach is to train a separate network for each specific task. However, there is a need for models that are closer to the human brain and can solve multiple tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is a branch of machine learning, in which multiple tasks learn simultaneously through a shared model. It has the following advantages: improving data efficiency, reducing overfitting through shared representation, and using auxiliary information to learn quickly.\nThe project has four objectives:\n1. One or more multi-task CV models trained (or borrowed, if the license is appropriate), and submitted to OpenCV model zoo. Specifically, at least MCN or networks with similar functions should be successfully transplanted or improved for OpenCV, and the accuracy and less computation should be provided, which is not lower than that of the existing single OpenCV model.\n2. quantize the model on the condition that the accuracy does not decrease too much. At least try to quantize the model and make a trade-off between performance and effectiveness at the end.\n3. Necessary patches, if any, for OpenCV DNN to support the provided multi-task models. Ideally, there should be an API introduced to optionally disable some parts of the multi-task CV model and save time by not computing unnecessary parts/heads of the model.\n4. Using at least one example will demonstrate how to use this multi-task model.",

To this end, in this proposal, we examine and explore two aspects of DB-KG:\n(a) A framework to create an image-based KG out of existing DBpedia entries;\n(b) Using the graph created to perform tasks like image querying, text + image search, and using relevant input images to add more images to existing articles.",

If time allows it, getting OpenQEMUBoardPkg to run on additional architecture could be another objective.\n\nThe first month could be used to get to a working UEFI shell, the second to add the missing features to get a feature-complete package for UEFI emulation, and if everything goes as planned, porting to other Qemu-supported architectures.\n\nFSP Stretch goal can be achieved by porting the existing QemuFSP package, reducing complexity for platform init on Intel platforms (which qemu-system-x86_64 emulates).",

          "description": "Taxonomies are an easy way to classify information into various categories. In Open Food Facts, taxonomies are used for classification, translation and linkage to useful properties such as nutri-score and allergens. Hence, taxonomies play a vital role in the Open Food Facts database and must be maintained properly.\n\nIn Open Food Facts, each taxonomy is in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph, where each leaf node has one or more parent nodes. There are conventions for indicating parent and child nodes. Product Opener has been using a text file for taxonomies, as it is an efficient and quick way for storing information. But, the files present in Open Food Facts are very long and thus, very cumbersome to edit by contributors.\n\nThe goal of this project is to alleviate this issue, by introducing a Taxonomy Editor. This tool would help contributors to quickly visualize the hierarchy of components in the taxonomy. It would enable fast search of a particular element and allow visualization of the element with multilingual synonyms as well. The visualization will include any inherited properties of the element too. The tool will authorize CRUD of properties, names and synonyms, within a taxonomy and will validate the taxonomy for errors such as duplicates and cycles. The tool would be able to figure out the consequences of a modification done to a taxonomy. This feedback would help contributors to understand how their changes might possibly bring any errors or unwanted side-effects.\n\nThe introduction of Taxonomy Editor will be very beneficial, as it will help to visualize how products are classified and would encourage more contributions from the wonderful community of contributors of Open Food Facts.\n\nDeliverables: Creation of a backend for parsing taxonomies, Provision for quick search of a component, Implement CRUD of elements in a taxonomy, Build hierarchy visualizations for taxonomies, Implementing validation of a taxonomy modification",

Implementing the offline save mechanism\n    With proper knowledge about the exact workflow how the data flow is, the first step \n    I think of storing the data for the already scanned and opened products. This inturn will\n    Facilitate the users to look up for the already scanned products without the need of an \n    Internet connection.\n\n3. Offline Edit Mode\n    After being done with the above two works, the 3rd and most important phase will be \n    Carried out. A clean and working mechanism to store the changes locally will be\n    Discussed with the mentors and start the work on the same to store the changes and \n    Sync those changes when online and delete the offline changes so as to keep the app\n    as lightweight as possible.\n\n4. Preloading Data\n    If time persists and the above work is done(which i am sure will be done), add a \n    mechanism to preload the data as cache (as step 2) so as to let the users use the app\n    For popular food items in their country out of the box\n\n4.

          "description": "The stakeholders of Open Food Facts consist of food consumers, food producers, government organizations, scientists and researchers. They all have different purposes for using OFF but the game-changer is data. All the data collected can be used for research, deciding the best health policies, and even to make better-informed food choices for people all around the globe. The Hunger Games leverage the results of the OCR used in OFF to validate more data and annotate new things to help train machine-learning models. The aim of this proposal is to add many more features and improve the UI as well as UX to retain contributors. Retaining contributors would ultimately, increase the labelling of data, resulting in better clusterisation and hence a more efficient model in terms of accuracy.\n\nTo get data and statistics about the contributions made by the volunteers, we need to assure that they have proper credentials and are logged in to OFF. But users tend to bounce back from the website if they have to directly create an account without knowing what the software does. The Hunger Games is mildly addictive and fun to play, so I propose to prompt users after say 10 questions to log in or sign up. \n\nMoreover, I plan to integrate the OFF-events leaderboard, badges, and more into the hunger games application which will create a metaverse environment for OFF. I will also add levels that will give the users a strong sense of satisfaction. To improve the usability of mobile devices, modify the hunger games into a PWA. Developing a PWA would reduce network calls in total hence, reduce the bounce back and idle period for the contributors before their period. \n\nIn addition to that, I plan to add new features like profile pages for contributors to showcase achievements, giving options for undoing the user’s actions, reporting and providing feedback to OFF, more autocompletion and filters, and so on. All these features will provide a pathway to having more reliable data.",

There exist various types of Internet data, mainly, tabular data (e.g., ASN or latency value), timeseries (e.g., AS hegemony per day), graphs (e.g., routing graph), paths (e.g., traceroutes, BGP paths). We will create at least one building block that can visualize each type of data. Different types of data need different types of visualizations. We will consider a range of visualizations, such as, sankey diagrams (very useful to visualize relations, paths, etc. in Internet data), graphs, geo-maps, distribution plots (e.g., histograms, violin plots), dendrograms, heatmaps.",

The goal of the proposal is to make the IHR’s internet application an end-to-end solution for stakeholders to work on. Currently, the IHR website provides plots of internet latency and routing for AS and countries. The goal of this software subsystem is to add new plots showing speed test data collected by Measurement-Lab so that users can monitor how disconnections and routing events impact throughput. While providing the users with a quick lookup for the NDT test it becomes immensely important to co-relate IHR traffic analysis with Google and Cloudflare reports. Collecting data from similar services would also pump IHR’s anomaly detector to complement IHR’s alerting system. With IHR the hub for multiple network reports and metrics, it is vital to have a dashboard to customize visual data. I propose to develop a customized IHR dashboard that is self-exploratory. The dashboard would let end users explore the IHR dataset and monitor any event with respect to time and legends according to their purpose. The dashboard would let the user select a set source and destination networks, time periods, and a metric and correspondingly plot the data. Ultimately, adding an assistant to select a set of important networks from a selected country or global statistics about the plotted data.",

In machine learning, 3D or 4D representation provides more depth information than the 2D representation, many of the tasks may be much better understood if we provide a 3D or 4D. But OpenVINO has no native real-time 3D visualization engine or library. This can be very troublesome for users who use display 3D images. So our goal is working natural 3D support for Jupyter Notebooks running OpenVINO (AI inference). There are a few solutions in Jupyter 3D graphic display, though:\n\n1. Requires complex setup, build or is not friendly to the average user (without graphics programming experience)\n2. Not integration with OpenVINO(Need process different data and different inference results available from OpenVINO, the user only needs a simple interface to set this up)\n\nThe project idea aims at fill in the gaps mentioned above:\n\n1. Provides a clean interface to set up the display of these graphics without the need for a graphical programming background(beginner-friendly)\n2. 3D support for Jupyter Notebooks running OpenVINO(Be able to transform and process the output data of OpenVino)",

The project will also ensure that the\ngeneration of snap package for each version of XWiki is integrated to the release process, so\nthat user on snap package do not remain outdated with the XWiki .It will also ensure close\nintegration so that the generation of snap package is not a big hassle for other developers for\neach version of XWiki. Automating snap builds would also be a feasible endeavour.\nObjectives achieved by this project: -\n• Making the installation easy and fast\n• Making XWiki work across a wide range of Linux distributions\n• To allow upstream software developers to distribute their applications directly to users.\n• Automating the snap build process thus reducing updating workload for the maintainers\nComponents to be build: -\n• Clean snap package of current XWiki\n• Automation of snap package generation",

          "description": "The proposed GSoC project aims at integrating support for the Faust audio programming language into HISE, an extensive framework for the creation of sample-based virtual musical instruments.\nThere are multiple ways to accomplish the integration, ahead-of-time compilation and just-in-time compilation, each with their specific benefits and shortcomings.\n\nThe most straight-forward method involves ahead-of-time compilation of the Faust code into a dynamic library which the HISE instrument can interface with.\nThis works well for finished products which will be exported and compiled once, but run many times.\nDuring prototyping, however, build time is essential and relinking the complete instrument would be excessive.\nIn that case machine code will be generated just-in-time (JIT) from the Faust source code whenever it is modified without recompiling or linking the rest of the instrument.\nFaust already provides the necessary mechanisms for just-in-time compilation via LLVM, which will be tied to suitable data structures inside HISE.\n\nLastly HISE also provides an integrated development environment (IDE) with a syntax-highlighting text editor to the instrument developer.\nProgramming the instruments in Faust should be an on-par experience to the developer when comparing to other supported languages, e.g., SNEX and JavaScript.\nTherefore the existing development environment will be extended to support the Faust language, while allowing the developer to still use their editors and tools outside of HISE.",

The global picture is that TES and WES are designed to complement each other in running workflows by first identifying and scheduling the different individual tasks in the right order (WES) and then executing them in a containerized manner.\n\nThis project is the implementation of a federated mechanism of task execution, i.e., different tasks of the same workflow will be executed in different Kubernetes clusters. These clusters can be in different geographical locations and be managed by different institutions. This can be achieved by introducing a dedicated “gateway TES” implementation, which receives an incoming task, runs a task distribution logic middleware to identify, out of several options, the most suitable TES instance, then relays the incoming task to that instance.",

          "description": "Current bioinformatics formats such as FASTQ, SAM, and VCF have been used in production for 10+ years via htslib/htsjdk. These are largely tabular text formats that are limited by their commitment to instant human-readability. On the other hand, other data file formats that exploit data locality, compression and other optimizations have been developed over the years to work with data sets from several other fields with different requirements than bioinformatics. These promise significant improvements over plaintext formats, including specialized compression, native data types, and efficient random access.\n\nThis project does not aim to create yet another format, instead, the goal is to explore the feasibility, and potential advantages of the serialization of bioinformatics formats into (potentially) many others for benchmarking purposes. To achieve this goal, we will implement additional serialization formats in the existing Noodles serialization library (see serde.rs for a short non-comprehensive list of currently supported output formats). Think of it like a rosetta stone from traditional bioinformatics formats to (ideally) the rest, where reasonable.\n\nNoodles, a Rust library that implements most of the high throughput sequencing (hts) specs already contains the most popular bioinformatics file format structs. This evaluation could be carried on by annotating the structures and semantics (providing a so-called IR, or “Internal Representation”) that the currently available bioinformatic file formats are built upon.\n\nThe end goal of this project would be to provide means to convert htslib format(s) into other binary representations (such as Apache Feather, Parquet, ORC, etc.) and then evaluate its convenience and performance via a benchmarking suite.",

Such an objective seems useful for: \nDiscovering the optimal format for performance critical applications.\nEasy conversion from one tool to another, for bioinformatics researchers and hackers.\n\nWe will achieve that by using an Internal Representation of the different possible semantic data represented in each format, that will then allow translation from one format to another.

Forward edge attacks (through function pointers and virtual calls) were proven to be less accessible after implementing Control-flow integrity (CFI) solutions. However, backward edge attacks easily bypass present instrumentation (Safe Stacks, canaries).\n\nUnder these circumstances, shadow stacks become more than necessary: shadow stacks are a defense mechanism that require metadata about the program’s state to enforce their policies. They protect the return value of the functions by comparing what’s pushed into them with what resides in the traditional stack, practically, functioning as a backup and check storage. \n\nMy project will consist of comparing different implementations of shadow stacks with their advantages and disadvantages, crafting a compelling PR, that would perfectly fit Unikraft's vision regarding modularization and portability and a clear discussion of the overhead brought by such an approach.",

          "description": "At the moment, Unikraft can leverage a single processor only. While there can be multiple threads (i.e., multiprogramming), no two activities actually run at the same time (i.e., multiprocessing). Unikraft introduces support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), thereby allowing it to execute code on all processors and cores of a system concurrently. This creates new challenges for synchronizing access to shared resources. On a single-processor machine synchronization primitives like mutexes and semaphores can consider interrupts as the only source of parallel execution. It is thus sufficient to protect a critical section of code by temporarily disabling interrupts. With SMP, however, this is no longer sufficient as other processors may access shared resources at any time.\nThe project will involve studying locking mechanisms used in modern kernels like Linux, FreeBSD, etc, improving the existing locking mechanisms in unikraft, and implementing new mechanisms such as read-write. The important part of the project will be identifying the critical sections present in the kernel and protecting these critical sections.",

          "description": "This project is to enable the selection of multiple blocks at the same time and allow moving and doing actions on multiple blocks on Blockly. This behaviour is pretty much the same as when you try to manage your files on your Operating System, and you can drag a rectangle to select multiple files, then moving them around, copying, deleting.\n\nThe design is that the Blocks multi-select feature will be only functional when you hold the Shift key, so that users can still drag the workspace when not. Users can simply click on the blocks to select or unselect them, or drag a rectangle to select a set of them at the same time. A button would also be added to enable multi-selection feature in case users are unable to access the keyboard.\n\nIt sounds like a little bit easy, but actually, I would say that it's not. Multiple selections can become a crazy-complex feature when you start thinking about the details. When dragging two blocks, you have to think about how the connections will work. When you right-click on multiple selections, you also have to make sure that those options apply to all blocks. And the touch screen problem would also need to be addressed.\n\nThe feature request (https://github.com/google/blockly-samples/issues/267) has remained open on the GitHub Issues for 6 years, but it's still in the discussion phase and far from the beginning of Implementation there. So I hope we can implement that during GSoC 2022 if possible.",

          "description": "[Problem]\nOpenAFS is a distributed file system. Currently, it has \"File ID\" or FID to \"entry\" or name lookup functionality, AKA, reverse lookup and also normal lookup, which is “name” for a given FID [afs_dir_Lookup and afs_dir_InverseLookup]. afs_dir_InverseLookup is currently computationally expensive because the algorithm scans a hash index data structure embedded within a \"Directory object\" [src/dir/dir.h] looking for a name that matches the given FID. It is not performant as it's merely brute-forcing the search.[src/dir/dir.c]\n\n[Solution]\nMaintain a separate hash table to store reverse lookup information with key: FID and value: name, the opposite of the existing hash table within in the Directory object. I would create this hash table within the Directory object again because it could avoid the penalty of maintaining a global data structure where all the information could be stored, and would also avoid the unnecessary loading of information of the entire volume, if only one file is looked up. Global table for all directories could also perhaps not scale to really large volumes. A \"lazy\" allocation of this table, that is, fill it in only when the first request is made per Directory Object for a \"reverse\" lookup would be efficient.\n\n[Deliverables]\n1. Code\n - Update the existing data structures [DirHeader], hereby referred to as DS.\n - Change the afs_dir_InverseLookup code to use the new DS\n - Lazy load* the information into the DS when the first request is made to “reverse” lookup.\n - Update the code* wherever directory updates are present (like adding and deleting a file inside the directory)\n * Ensure the synchronization primitives are correctly used\n \n2. Tests\n - Correctness tests: check if the written code is working as expected. Asserts can be added to ensure both the hash tables are coherent.\n - Performance tests: check the speed of execution of the current code vs the new code in the same environment (HW and OS)\n\n3.

          "description": "The erddapy package provides a Python interface to the ERDDAP data server API. Currently, most of erddapy's functionality is concentrated into a single class, and the URL building features are implemented in that class along with the data transformation methods that process server responses into Python objects, such as Pandas DataFrames.\n\nThis project proposes to separate erddapy into core and object (or opinionated) layers. The former will hold the URL building and data transformation functionality, which will be reused by the rest of the library. The latter layer will provide high-level objects that will support a functional API that does not depend on the state of the underlying object (which is the case for the current version of erddapy). This functional API will provide cleaner iterative usage when querying multiple servers and datasets, and new classes implemented in the object layer will support serialization so that they can be pickled and passed on to other processes or machines.\n\nTo execute this project, I delineate two separate aims: refactoring the URL building and data transformation functionality into a new module containing minimal, standalone functions and reusing those functions in the existing primary class; and implementing an additional layer containing the high-level objects that will provide the basis for the functional API. Overall, this will greatly improve the flexibility and scalability of the package, and will help support its wide spectrum of users.",

The newly added snapshot will be made available for use with the CI builds. Moreover, the extension of EAT with additional multiversion android projects (described at the second phase) will begin. Continuing to the 2nd Phase (July 2022 - September 2022), new multiversion Android projects will be added to EAT. In EAT there is already a basic android  multiversion example. This will be extended with other open source android projects demonstrating how EAT can be used to support multiversion real life android projects. Finally, during the 3rd Phase ( September 2022 – November 2022) a multi-version Android application will be developed and added to EAT. This app will enable users to upload  and view descriptions and ways of usage for various programs or functions.

          "description": "Kubernetes is a great tool for container orchestration, running Kubernetes in your production environment is getting traction in the Cloud industry. With growing DevOps tools, it is now a tedious and time-consuming task SREs and developers to continuously monitor their remote applications running inside a multicluster Kubernetes environment. Though there are some great tools using which we can monitor Kubernetes tools there is a need for easy deployment setup and an alerting tool that people can use to get alerts when something goes wrong inside their application running in a Kubernetes environment. It is often time-consuming to figure out the root cause of such issues, and most importantly not all alerts and issues are important and do not need human interaction. This brings us to address the problem of out of box metrics, traces, events and logs collection for applications running inside Kubernetes, reporting all the collected data on a single dashboard and push notifications to users for critical ones. The collected metrics, traces, events and logs will help to debug the application running inside Kubernetes faster and effectively.",

The *past* part deals with long-standing bugs that had fallen through the cracks, fixing those lost and forgotten bugs.

There are two types of power analyses: static, which is more of an estimation that ignores circuit operations, and dynamic, which simulates the circuit behavior in conjunction with switching power. These tools are Verilog gate level-simulations and SPICE simulations, respectively, but the former can be inaccurate while the latter is computationally demanding. IRSIM, a tool intermediate between these two simulation tools, simulates the circuit as a network of transistor capable of turning ON and OFF, serving as a tradeoff between speed and accuracy in dynamic power analysis.

Integrating an IAM with Payment-Hub will help balance security with efficiency, giving customers quick access to their finances while barring anyone else. As other digital technologies become increasingly agile, customers become more accustomed to speed, making these considerations more critical. Also, with the rise in remote access to the system, we must have a secure way to authenticate and authorize users. If every employee had access to all data, one breached account could spell disaster for an entire Financial Organization. IAM brings in the segmentation and privilege restriction aspects which is necessary as remote access expands. The agility benefits of segmentation and digital identities make IAM the ideal solution. \n\nGoal: \n\nIntegrating an Identity and Access Management system (Anubis/Keycloak) to Payment-Hub.\n\nProject Impact:\n\nCurrently, there is no Identity manager in Payment-Hub and users are authenticated only using basic auth. Integrating an IAM System(Keycloak) with Payment Hub will have the following major impacts:\n- Single Sign-On capability: There will be unique sign-on credentials for access to any system, network or service. Keycloak can be used to integrate this.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication: It will involve two or more forms of login credentials for information access.\n- Privileged Access Management: We would be able to bound users to a set of privileges/access. This will provide a secure way to monitor access control with more visibility. \n- Securing APIs: IAM system will also help secure APIs and API Keys.\n\nDeliverables: \n\nThe deliverables are divided into three main tasks, namely,\n- Token Introspection\n- Scope Check\n- OAuth MTLS",

Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is a typical example of a constraint-based metabolic model (CBMM) [2]. However, flux sampling is considered a superior methodology. Python package dingo provides the Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling (MMC) algorithm to sample from the flux space of a metabolic network.

This problem is technically difficult due to the constraints of correlation matrices (entries in [-1,1], positive semi-definiteness). The current methods can only scale to a few tens of dimensions.\n\nThis project aims to provide efficient C++ implementations for new geometric-flavored algorithms to sample correlation matrices (Arakelian, Chalkis 2021)  and integrate them into VolEsti, an open-source high-performance software for sampling, volume computing and geometric statistics. Our main tasks consist of implementing a new class of convex bodies to represent the space of correlation matrices and geometric operations for performing two random walk sampling algorithms (the accelerated billiard walk and Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm) over those convex bodies. These tasks can be supported by the already existing geometric facilities of VolEsti and the theoretical results found in related works. We will focus mainly on building an optimized C++ code to achieve better scalability for those algorithms and carry out intensive experiment and benchmark with other competitors to justify our efficiency. \n\nThe expected duration of this project is 175 hours spread over 7 weeks of coding period (June 13 - July 29).

The implemented sampler should return samples from log-concave distributions constrained in polytopes as well as spectrahedra.  First of all, the initial implementation will be based on very recent promising research about an RHMC algorithm constrained in polytopes. We will expand on this effort by extending its capabilities to handle Spectrahedra. Afterwards, the above implementation will be used as a subroutine for a Semidefinite Program (SDP) solver. Last but not least, we will also include benchmark tests to compare the efficiency of our code against other state of the art libraries.

          "description": "KerasNLP is a library for building NLP building blocks such as model layers, metrics, tokenizers, text processing/augmentation techniques, etc. I have contributed a few of these modules myself, and would like to contribute more such modules during GSoC. \n\nFirstly, I would like to contribute NLP-specific metrics. Here, I plan to implement metrics which are not present in Keras, and which are generally used for NLP tasks. Most of these metrics will be implemented as live training metrics, i.e., they can be input to `model.compile` and computed during training. Hence, the implementation should be \"in graph mode\". The metrics I wish to implement are: BLEU Score, Word Error Rate [WER], Character Error Rate [CER], CHRF, CHRF++ and BLEURT.\n\nSecondly, I wish to add functions for decoding strategies. Text Generation is an important problem in NLP. It encompasses tasks like summarisation, machine translation, story generation, etc. During inference, we need to sequentially decode the output of the encoder-decoder model. This is where these utility functions will help users. I plan to implement popular decoding strategies like Random Sampling, Greedy Sampling, Beam Search, top-k Sampling and top-p (nucleus) Sampling.\n\nI also want to add model encoder layers. KerasNLP does not aim to build complete models; it aims to build \"building blocks\" from which models can be built. Keeping this in mind, some encoder layers which I aim to implement are (these encoder layers can then be stacked up to form the complete model): Reformer and ConvBERT (or gMLP) encoder blocks.\n\n\nText augmentation means perturbing the samples in the original dataset to increase the size of the training set. This is where native text augmentation layers can be immensely useful. Backtranslation and Contextual Word Augmentation are methods which I will implement.\n\nThe above modules are explained in details in the proposal document.",

          "description": "Data Scarcity is a Huge and Evergrowing Problem as new tasks and problems are tackled. Sometimes collecting substantial amount of data is almost impossible/ extremely expensive as well incases of Low Resource Languages etc. hence Deep Learning Practitioners have moved to Data Augmentation Techniques to create synthetic data from real data. In Computer Vision the parallels are very clear for instance zooming in on an image or rotating an image retains labels in most cases however in Language wrong modifications can lead to mislabeling of data pretty quickly and hence it's much more trickier to perform Data Augmentation in these cases.\nThrough my proposal I would like to add 10 Data Augmentation Techniques most of which are Rule Based but have been used extensively in NLP literature to achieve substantial improvements. Having these Techniques as layers would make it convenient for users to add these techniques to their workflow and push models into training. Tweaking augmentations would also be less of a hassle as currently most Data Augmentation libraries don't offer seamless integration with models without writing custom code. \\\nThe 10 Techniques I plan to implement are Synonym Replacement, Random Deletion, Random Swaps, Random Insertion, Stop Word Dropout, Character Level Swap, Keyboard Typo, SentenceShuffle, Remove Duplicate Sentences and Back Translation\nAll of these techniques have been used in Heavily Cited Works making them the perfect candidates to add to the list.\nBy the end of the GSOC tenure my goal is to have these techniques fully implemented as layers with accompanying tutorials to get started with them for new users to quickly add these to their workflows once the library has a formal release.",

          "description": "I will potentially work towards the following problems during the GSoC:\n\n1)  I am excited to implement advanced algorithms in JAX and create/re-produce demos/figures to put in textbooks. For example, recently I implemented Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) from scratch in JAX. Readers can easily connect maths with code by referring to this kind of from-scratch implementation. Also, pure JAX code can introduce some unique features of JAX such as  lax.scan() to optimize the training loop.\n\n2)  I will improve the quality of the existing figures in textbooks using a set of matplotlib configurations we use in our group for research papers. For example, In Figure 2.4 of book1, due to missing y-label, x-label, and legend, readers may find difficulty in understanding the figure. I will fill these small gaps and also improve the figure by applying latexify on them. Latexify is a function that applies latex effects by setting consistent font style, font size, and figure size with other text in the book.  For example, this gist (https://gist.github.com/karm-patel/9c5c2ee77afd495759ed1a2aad0e460e) shows an improvement of the above figure. I have already started to work on this thread and contributed by improving Figure 2.2, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.5, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.11, and Figure 2.15 of the book1. \n\n3) Add an Interactive demo for figures wherever applicable: I will add some interactive demos for figures so the reader can visualize the effect of variables in a particular problem. For example, figure 2.9  shows two different binomial distributions for two different θ (probability of success). I have added an interactive demo as shown in this notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/binom_dist_plot.ipynb) In above notebook readers can change θ and understand the effect of θ on the binomial distribution.",

Considering the gravity of this situation, analyzing, and diagnosing CVDs has quickly become a crucial task. However, in the presence of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) (doctors, radiologists, etc.…) this task becomes trivial, but in the absence of SMEs diagnosing CVDs with the help of an Electrocardiogram (ECG), a Phonocardiogram (PCG) is almost always impossible. In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is drastically underfunded and the vast majority of these countries are unable to provide basic healthcare to the public. In such conditions, the availability of radiologists or doctors is very unlikely. Automated analysis and classification of PCG signals and ECG images without the presence of any subject matter expert (SME) is a crucial task.

          "description": "Switching to Conscrypt, simulating the security APIs becomes much more high-fidelity and it achieves the goal of Robolectric to make it similar to an Android environment.\n\nCurrently, Robolectric uses BouncyCastle as the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) security provider. Starting in Android P, Android switched to using Google Conscrypt as the security provider. To be more consistent with Android, Robolectric should update the default security provider to Conscrypt.\n\nAs it is using the BouncyCastle, this means that whenever the JCA APIs are used in a Robolecetric test, BouncyCastle will be used by default. Officially, In Android the default JCE provider is Conscrypt. This is a Java wrapper over BoringSSL. The goal is to have Robolectric switch from BouncyCastle by default to Conscrypt.\n\nThe Conscrypt module uses BoringSSL, a native library that is a Google fork of OpenSSL and which is used in many Google products like Google Chrome for cryptography and TLS. \n \nConscrypt uses Java code and a native library to provide the Android TLS implementation as well as a large portion of Android cryptographic functionality such as key generators, ciphers, and message digests. Conscrypt is relatively selective and focuses on the most important and widely-used algorithms. \n\nConscrypt also supports the curves in Elliptic Curves crypto operations and it is much faster than BouncyCastle as it is optimized native code.

It has been developed to support indoor environments for now.

To ease the transition of RMF Traffic Editor into one that is capable for Autonomous Vehicles (AV), the minimum standard would be for Traffic Editor to match the basic capabilities of the map builders for these simulators.\n\nFrom the LGSVL map annotator, and RoadRunner (CARLA’s map maker), we are able to identify common features that are required for an AV map maker. When we compare it with the existing feature on Traffic Editor, we are able to identify the missing components to work on.\n\nThus, this project aims to create basic features to support AV simulation. Based on my current research, Traffic Editor has many features but not all are documented in the official documentation. Thus, to support the further development of this project, documentation will also be done to help new developers learn the current capabilities of Traffic-Editor, as well as how to contribute to the project.",

          "description": "For Joomla, the convenience of its users is on its priority list and Guided Tour is something that will definitely make it easy for its users to use Joomla. Those who use Joomla! will prefer a basic help text and interface over reading bulky documentation for any action they want to execute. Though it is properly detailed in an easy manner in the documentation, the user has to visit a separate link for documentation. It would be easy for the user if he/she can get that on the same page without any redirection and in the form of some iframes.\nIt could be better if this would be a complete tour of the click-through path as that will increase the convenience for users in a much more professional and better way and even to make this feature more user friendly, a user can create custom tours as per the requirement.\nAlso, this will allow third-party developers to ship their own tours with their extensions which will make it easier for the users, who will use the extension to be familiar with the same.",

Currently, these transitions have to be triggered manually which can cause errors and is really boring. Automating them will reduce errors and website owners can then focus on their content instead of managing the states of these. This will be achieved by providing a new interface in the editor of the components which support workflows in the backend. Every built chain will be saved in the params of the respective element and a Scheduled Task in combination with a controlling database table finally execute the transitions. The end result of this project will be a Joomla! Plugin which provides on one hand the UI for creating and editing the transition chains but also the logic for executing them.",

          "description": "Data is the new big thing for search engines in today’s time but it can be difficult for web crawlers to effectively interpret the context of the data. To deliver better search results, web crawlers need to have a context of the data and to understand the data better, structured data is used. Structured data is the data which conforms to a data model, has a well defined structure, follows a consistent order and can be easily accessed and used by a person or a computer program. It is used by search engines to generate rich snippets, which are small pieces of information that will then appear in search results making the search results more relevant.\nCurrently Joomla! has rich snippets implemented but it uses inline microdata to implement rich snippets which is difficult to modify from the backend as it is hard coded into the html. With this project I’ll be working on to making it easier for the user to dynamically integrate structured data from the backend. \nFor the dynamic integration of structured data I’ll be using schema.org which provides a universally recognized format for structuring data on the Web. There are different ways to implement schema markup but for this project I’ll be using JSON-LD as it can be inserted into the web page without disrupting other contents or HTML and it is easy to store in the database. This project will help user to add, update or delete schema markup on the articles from the backend. It will give user an option to select the type of schema from the available schema types and then insert values for the attributes of schema properties in the form. Some useful data which is already present in other forms will be fetched using AJAX Interface and it will be directly inserted into the JSON object. After saving the article, the generated schema will be pushed into the head element of the page.",

There are also further regressions to be addressed caused by the GTK 4 port.\nMy proposal for this project is to design and implement a new UI for this feature that will mainly resolve the discoverability problem - when there are no templates in the Templates directory, the new document menu is not shown, and many users don’t know about its existence. Another thing I’ll focus on is the ability to easily add more templates, which could possibly require various changes across the ecosystem. I will be working in close cooperation with the Nautilus developers, GNOME design team, and with various user studies in mind. \nMy main goals are following:\n1. Design and implement an empty state in the New Documents menu, that will offer the user the ability to add new templates, both pre-defined as well as custom.\n2. Making use of visual representations of each template, such as icons, to help users find what they’re looking for.\n3. Add the ability to search the list of templates to add to the menu.",

Inventory/Evaluation Phase: Variations in individual elements and composite components from each website are recorded to ensure all alternates are captured.\n\n2. Iterative Design Phase: Mockups are created for each evaluated component considering all the possible variations encountered during evaluation. The mockups will be subsequently iterated upon after review and deliberation with the Design Team and other project stakeholders.\n\n3.

          "description": "Density functional theory (DFT) is an established method to compute the electronic structure of matter, with applications ranging from the development of catalysts to the discovery of new drugs. DFT finds an approximation of the Schrödinger equation corresponding to the studied system: this approximation comes to solving coupled non-linear partial differential equations. To deal with this method of simulation, the DFTK package is being developed in Julia.\nTo reduce runtime, we wish to develop the use of a local GPU to offload computations. However, the goal is to minimize the amount of code which needs to be adapted: having two different versions of the code existing at the same time (one for CPU and one for GPU) can be difficult to maintain in an open-source framework. This also makes the implementation of new algorithms difficult, and can deter newcomers from getting involved in the project. Since GPU algorithms for DFT already exist, the main challenge is to orchestrate the overall flow of data between CPU and GPU.\nWe believe expanding the DFTK package will showcase the possibilities the Julia programming language offers and bring together many different communities involved in molecular simulation.\nI aim to produce an alternate version of code of the DFTK package using GPU framework by clearly highlighting the differences with the CPU version and keeping code changes as low as possible.",

Given an initial set, modeling the uncertainty on the initial state, it aims to answer the question \"What is the set containing all possible final states?\" This question is relevant in several domains such as safety-critical applications and systems verification. Traditional approaches have mainly concentrated to convex sets, which can lead to overestimation of the final state when this is actually non-convex (so-called wrapping effect). Recently, Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes (SPZ) have been introduced as a set representation for  both convex and non-convex sets. SPZ have been shown to have a compact representation that allows efficient manipulation.\nThe goal of this project is to implement Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes in LazySets.jl and the corresponding reachability algorithms in ReachabilityAnalysis.jl for the JuliaReach organization. The final result will be a state-of-the-art (SOTA) toolbox for reachability analysis with sparse polynomial zonotopes, together with systematic benchmarks comparing our Julia implementation both to different implementations of the same approach and other SOTA approaches in reachability analysis.",

          "description": "The hardware necessary to build networks, sensors and computers of quantum nature is at its infancy. Potential quantum memories, repeaters, and switches are being researched all over the world, and the quantum hardware race has started.  Therefore, a need for efficient, functional, and accurate open-source quantum networking modelling tools has never been more imminent. Projects such as Julia’s QuantumClifford.jl enable researchers across the globe to research various aspects of quantum networking while anticipating the creation of the necessary hardware to produce laboratory experiments. They present cheap and efficient environments to start building potential switch, protocol, and network designs. \n\nIn classical computing, if one wants to protect a bit against errors, it can often suffice to represent that bit by a logical bit by repeating the data bit. Nevertheless, in a quantum setting, that type measurement is much more complex. Quantum qubit theory along with quantum noise present one of the most challenging problems that the quantum information field must overcome to become scalable and profitable: How to account for the error correction, needed due to quantum noise, in quantum gates?  \n\nSimulators, such as Julia's Clifford gate simulator, must mimic not only the behaviour of quantum noise, but also the effects of currently proposed quantum error correction codes. For this reason, this project proses a comprehensive library of frequently used quantum error correcting codes for Julia’s simulator of Quantum Clifford Circuits. These would include the Steane, Shor, and Toric codes, as well as other Surface and CSS quantum error correction codes.",

The hybrid variant (HDS) sits in the middle in terms of accuracy and speed between DS and FDS. Since demands for the two differ according to situation, it makes sense to implement all thre versions (DS, FDS, and HDS) so that everyone interested can use the one most suitable to their situation.

This is caused by the underlying Just-In-Time compilation, and the current solution is to build a user system image containing pre-loaded libraries with precompiled code. However, the workflow is primarily manual, and users are forced to recompile the system image after any package update. Currently, Julia's developers work on introducing system-image-like blobs containing compiled native code for a specific package. However, both these methods compile only package-specific precompile statements by default, and the project will introduce a new package to change this paradigm. The package would collect precompile statements during normal usage of Julia and offer to recompile the system image (or blobs) once the libraries are updated.

          "description": "Overall, the proposal is about adding a few missing features in the package, like addition of new models, some metaprogramming, lazy evaluation, testing, documentation and linting. \nCurrently, the package only supports four regression models (Linear, Logistic, Poisson and Negative Binomial regression). There is a huge scope of adding many more models to the package. To start with, we can add the Gamma and Inverse Gaussian regression models, and the ARIMA model for time series. Over time, more models can be added to the package.\nThere is also a scope of adding new macros to the package to make the syntax more clean. An example of this is in the fitmodel function of the package (and is explained via a code snippet in the proposal). From the documentation, it can also be seen that any model has many attributes which are computed when the fit function is called. When working on big data, it is possible that not all the attribute values are needed, so it is currently inefficient to compute every attribute. Instead, one can compute the attributes lazily, i.e as and when they are needed. Rigorous unit testing should be added to the package to ensure code correctness. Also, the package code can use a lot of help with its documentation and code coverage. All of these can be implemented using CI/CD. Finally, in its current state, the package lacks strict code conventions (like variable names, commit message rules etc). These are essential to ensure good quality code and to make the job easier for future contributors. To enforce this, linting can be added to the code along with Git hooks to enforce these conventions. Also, a well defined API should be documented for the models, so that new models can be added at ease.",

          "description": "The Julia REPL and notebooks like Jupyter Notebooks, Pluto.jl both have shortcomings, especially when considering Julia's data science work. For example, the Julia REPL requires additional packages to display images in the REPL and is inconvenient for repeated use. Images also clog the REPL, making it more inconvenient when pre-processing data. On the other hand, notebooks lack debugging tools and waste a lot of space in their layouts.\n\nA straightforward and extensible solution that uses the REPL and customizes it to our needs can bridge this feature and convenience gap. The TermLayouts.jl project aims to add extensions to the REPL and introduce a layout in which these extensions can be moved and resized to fit the user's needs. This layout can further be customized using a configuration file.\n\nThis project will also seek to provide some essential extensions which most users would like to have. These extensions include a variable inspector, a fully-fledged debugger, and a plot area for displaying images.\n\nAll the code will be thoroughly tested using unit tests and documented extensively for future ease of maintenance.",

The new command line option will enable the user to specify the directories of the licenses and rules that they’d like to use.\n\nThe second part of the approach is modifying ScanCode toolkit internals to work with this new command line option, and to handle the creation and maintenance of indexes for any new license sets.

          "description": "The write operation in flash can only change bits in a specific way and the erase operation changes all the bits of a block to 1s. So to modify any bit the whole block needs to be copied to another memory, erased on the flash, and then copied again from the other memory with the change. Due to this “erase overhead” write operations may require copying a lot of data to modify a small amount. Most flash chips support multiple erase-block sizes and flashrom keeps a list of these sizes and ranges for all supported flash chips. Currently, flashrom tries these functions one by one and uses the same function until the operation is completed or an error occurs. Usually, the first function works correctly but this function erases the smallest erase-block so flashrom would have to use it multiple times to complete the erase operation on a large region, which could have been done more efficiently using functions using larger erase-blocks, thus resulting in a transaction overhead. If a large erase-block size to erase a small region is chosen it would result in a larger erase overhead. So the erase-block size should be picked according to the size of the region left to be erased. Also checking in advance to tell if the programmer supports the given erase function and then sorting the supported functions in order of the erase-block sizes can further help the function selection.",

I'll be bolstering the configuration standard to prevent security risks posed due to misconfigurations. At the end of the project, Submitty will be more secure along with having stronger mechanisms to catch vulnerabilities at an early stage and thus making continuous integration more reliable.",

Submitty already has good support for most of it’s web features on mobiles and tablets and I would like to carry the work forward in the assimilation of more of its features and webpages in variety of display resolutions. With this done we can experiment and analyze various platforms in order to successfully implement the creation and maintenance of PWA for submitty , this will include exploring a platform that provides best support for all feature on variety of devices in the most optimal way.\nAfter we are done with selection , work on essential components like Manifest,  Service worker , Caching and fetching of the assets, Optimal UI/UX for installation and other features could we worked upon. Then the work on some errors and compatibility issues could be done. Atlast the proper documentation for all the work including the usage , installation etc could be done.",

          "description": "Valhalla is a routing engine built on OpenStreetMap data, that allows for high flexibility by providing diverse routing modes and routing filters. \n\nInitially, Valhalla received transit data from Transitland API, which converts GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data into a database. However, Transitland data is no longer compatible with Valhalla due to their internal updates. To bring back transit routing support to Valhalla and make it less reliant on third-party software, it can receive transit data from GTFS directly. \n\nThere are downsides of simply updating the code for Transitland: (a) it is dependent on OpenstreetMap, making Valhalla heavier, while GTFS can be independent, (b) Valhalla is still vulnerable to future changes in Transitland code that may break the code.  Therefore, this proposal is for an independent integration of transit data from RAW GTFS, rather than being dependent on a third-party platform.",

          "description": "Nominatim is OSM’s own geocoding software. When a user is searching for a specific place, Nominatim returns multiple results that are likely to be what the user is looking for. These search results are ranked based on their importance values that are being derived from looking at the popularity of the locations’ Wikipedia articles. However, not every place on Earth has its own Wikipedia article. As a result, each of the places that do not have their own Wikipedia articles does not have an assigned importance value to be used to rank them correctly among the other locations in the search result. OSM publishes aggregate map access numbers that are generated based on the users’ behavior when using the map. These access numbers are a good indicator of how popular a place is. The aim of this project is to integrate the map access numbers into Nominatim to compute an importance value for all places regardless of whether they have their own Wikipedia article or not. In order to fulfill the aim of this project, a set of deliverables needs to be defined and accomplished. These are:\n\n1) Finding the most suitable method of importing GeoTIFF files \n2) Developing the import functionality\n3) Investigating and developing the importance value computation algorithm based on the map access numbers\n4) Writing unit tests\n5) Documenting the new changes",

          "description": "With the increase in use of technology and the internet, the risks associated with the internet are also increasing at a very high rate. Hence, it is necessary to have a system in place to protect our systems from such risks. The risk of malicious attacks is especially higher when browsing the internet. Thus, there is a need for an external system to intervene and block any unauthorized requests to the web server. A web application firewall(WAF) does just that. Modsecurity follows the OWASP Core Rule Set(CRS) rules to detect any vulnerabilities. This helps make web browsing more secure. The CRS has different Paranoia Levels which represent different security levels. At higher paranoia levels, the system has a stricter set of rules to block malicious activities. However, at such high paranoia levels, many genuine requests also get blocked as they resemble malicious activities. These are known as false positives. Such a large number of false positive detections hinders the user experience and as a result, they may stop using CRS and compromise security. Hence, it is important to reduce the number of false positive detections. As the data isn’t labeled, using an appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm is the best possible way to achieve this. With the existing proposal by Floriane Gilliéron as a basis, I would work on an unsupervised learning algorithm for the machine learning plugin and aim to get it integrated as an official plugin. I will also add additional features to the plugin.",

Then on the UI side, you have options to put text in blocks. A block will contain text, a time interval in the video and an image we\nwill show at that time interval. That’s how we can make multiple blocks after submitting the data. We will call the backend REST APIs in Django or flask, which will take those data blocks containing time intervals images and text.

          "description": "Analyzing positional features/annotations in sequences is important in bioinformatics. Visualizing such data is quite a challenging task, considering the large amount of data to be displayed. The feature viewer is an open source javascript library developed to visualize biological data (referred to as features) mapped to a linear sequence (Paladin et al., 2020). For instance, it can be configured to visualize the location of protein domains or amino acid variations in a protein sequence. The feature viewer is being used in several popular bioinformatics resources such as neXtProt and COSMIC 3D.\n\nCurrently, the feature viewer supports limited configurability options in the features displayed, such as the color, shape and on-click behavior. This is too restrictive for some of the possible use cases of the feature viewer, where more flexibility is required in the display of features. One such instance is when different types of amino acid variants should be displayed in a color-specific manner in the same feature track.\n\nThe overall goal of this project is to improve the configurability of the feature viewer, such that it allows greater flexibility in the visualization of detailed biological data.",

          "description": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is a popular method in proteomics, metabolomics and protein interaction analysis. OpenMS is one of the most widely acknowledged tools in computational MS analysis, without which many exciting scientific breakthroughs would not be possible. With the development of mass spectrometers with high resolution and sensitivity, the amount and size of data generated by mass spectrometry has been increasing rapidly. The previously established data format, mzML, which is in essence an XML file, cannot be efficiently stored or accessed when the file size is huge. In response to the need of a space- and time-efficient data format to store MS data, a new data format mzMLb has been introduced. It adopts the hierarchical HDF5 format which allows the application of BLOSC compression filters to gain a huge compression rate with splendid IO performance. OpenMS currently does not support this file format as an input.\nThis proposal aims to implement an IO module for mzMLb files for OpenMS, which provides variou compression filters including the most efficient BLOSC filter and customizable chunk size plus other options.

For documentation, it seems necessary to make certain additions to better orient developers who are new to 3D graphics and shaders, including graphics quirks that go beyond p5.js, such as the depth sorting challenges mentioned in issue #5420.

A powerful Machine Learning library can expand the possibility of Processing by enabling the users to create cool AI-powered art, games, and interactive applications. Furthermore, a well-implemented ML library in Processing can be an effective tool to lower the barrier of AI/ML and teach ML to beginners in a friendly way. Though there are some ML libraries such as OpenCV for Processing and Deep Vision for Processing, there is no one universal ready-to-use ML library that is friendly for beginners. Additionally, the speech/audio models and text models are not supported by any of the existing libraries. By using the OpenVINO’s Java Inference Engine, this library resolves the aforementioned issues by enabling powerful pre-trained models from OpenVINO’s model zoo, including speech/audio and text models.",

          "description": "The main idea of IQS in digiKam is to determine the quality of an image and convert it into a score. This score is based on four criteria which are factors sabotaging image: blur, noise, exposure, and compression. The current approach is useful to determine images distorted by one of these reasons. However, the current algorithm presents also some drawbacks : It demands a lots of fine tuning from user's side and it's cannot work on aesthetic image. So, I propose the solution of deep learning algorithm. While the dataset and the paper for aesthetic image quality assessment are free to use, we are capable of constructing a mathematical model that can learn the pattern of a dataset, hence, predict the score of quality. As deep learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesn’t require the setting for the hyperparameters. Hence,  we can reduce most of the fine-tuning parts to make this feature easier to use",

          "description": "PROBLEM:\n\nFlatpaks and Snap applications run in isolation from rest of the system, therefore they do not have access to the system resources (such as directories, buses and devices) that other applications take for granted. They access these permissions through Portals (in Flatpak's case) and Interfaces (in Snap's case).\n\nDiscover is KDE's application for installing software. Presently, Discover can show what permissions are necessary by Snaps and Flatpaks, but lacks a mechanism to change Flatpak's permissions. Flatpaks can access buses, but it is unclear what these buses do, to users. Snaps do offer a mechanism for changing these permissions within Discover's interface (through a popup), but this has 2 problems: first, the permissions will not be understandable to most users; second, the method of displaying these permissions is inconsistent with how it is done for Flatpaks.\n\nThe project's goal is to implement a mechanism to alter these permissions and their extents in a system settings module for each application, and show Snap permissions in a more informative, easier-to-digest way on Discover's interface, like for Flatpaks.\n\nPLAN TO IMPLEMENT:\nThe project is broken into 2 stages: the first is implementation of the feature that allows tweaking of Flatpak's application. This should be done by the end of Week 7. The second is the feature to display Snaps permissions more informatively on Discover's interface, like it is done for Flatpaks. This stage will take up the remainder of the weeks. \n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1. mechanism to alter Flatpak permissions through a System Settings module for each application\n2. mechanism to alter Snaps' permissions through a System Settings module, for each application\n3. displaying Snap permissions with additional information such as brief descriptions and icons in their application pages\n4. implementation of an \"internal dictionary\" to explain what access level to each bus on the system implies to the user",

(2) Producing blog posts about my experiences with the community and the project, tutorials on what I learned, and explanations that are less technical than the proper documentation, so as to reach more people. (3) Generating proper coverage reports and documenting the process for doing so.

          "description": "For simulating a system that contains many variables and/or equations, traditionally computational engineers tend to focus on utilizing an appropriate method with realistic time and space complexity. The technique of model order reduction (MOR), however, aims at approximating the original model with reduced number of variables and/or equations and still keeping sufficient accuracy. MOR is especially useful in various industries, for example thermal-fluids engineering, micro-electro-mechanical systems and control, where large-scale simulations have to be performed.\n\nThe methods of model order reduction can be classified into several classes including proper orthogonal decomposition, reduced basis, balanced truncation, etc. Several MOR libraries have been well developed in MATLAB and Python. For instance, pyMOR is a Python library that relies on the application of reduced basis methods to parameterized partial differential equations. MATLAB's model reducer supports pole-zero simplification, balanced truncation mode selection methods and so on.\n\nIn Julia, the main package that enables symbolic modeling is ModelingToolkit.jl, whose key features consist of automatic transformation and structural simplification, but it needs further works on fast ML approximate transformations. So this project is targeted on implementing MOR methods as extended features for ModelingToolkit.jl. Besides implementation of methods of model order reduction, the expected deliverables will include documentation which shows both the improved simulation time and accuracy penalty for the application of different MOR methods on test problems from various disciplines.",

Fortunately, modern hardware such as graphical processing units (GPUs) can improve the computational efficiency of large vector and matrix operations.

          "description": "Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs), a type of Bayesian nonparametric models, have recently gained strong attention from researchers, and become an active research topic in machine learning’s multi-task learning. The advantage of multi-output GPs is its capacity to simultaneously learn and infer many outputs which have the same source of uncertainty from inputs. This provides a useful and practical approach for various applications in different fields. \n\nThe creation of new sampling methods and the advance in computing power have paved the way for the development of Bayesian models. Different software frameworks have been built to facilitate this probabilistic programming approach. Among those, PyMC is one of the most popular frameworks with a large and strong community. PyMC provides friendly interfaces that allow users in academics and industries to perform both parametric and nonparametric Bayesian data analysis. For Bayesian nonparametric models, the Gaussian process module in PyMC supports various mean and kernel classes. However, the current GP implementations in PyMC are limited to single output. This project aims to add support for multi-output GPs in PyMC. This feature would significantly extend the capabilities of this important module and benefit the PyMC community.",

          "description": "The study of urban morphology relies on clever abstractions of the built environment into computationally tractable models. One such model, the street network, is a graph whose edges are streets and nodes are street intersections. Network analysis tools are often tailored for street networks with the purpose of routing. In shortest path computations, network data must carefully reflect not only urban infrastructure but also the intricacy of transportation policies–such as multiple lanes and traffic direction. From the perspective of urban morphology, these features add noise to the geometric order of cities. Perpendicular two-lane streets cross in four intersections, producing a dummy city block, for example. Street networks carefully processed to answer pressing accessibility questions are not suitable for morphological analysis.\n\nWe would like to develop source-agnostic functions to process street network data for meaningful morphological analysis. The final network should be, at least, free from multiple nodes representing the same intersection and multiple edges representing the same street. This processing must rely on inherent network properties such as node connectivity and edge lengths, but not on auxiliary data such as OSM tags and building footprints. The functions will be collected under pysal’s momepy module, added to an existing toolbox of scalable urban morphological analysis.",

          "description": "The project aims to fill the current gap in the creation of a baseline urban grid that allows for network analysis of the morphology of street networks. The idea of the project is to develop a set of tools within the current momepy.preprocessing module that combined with the current integration of NetworkX can output a solid, consistent and repeatable analysis of the urban form. \nGiven that other libraries have also approached this issue (namely osmnx.simplification and citiyseer.tools.graphs), the idea is to contribute from the persisting issues of such libraries to then continue with a solution that is much more independent. Issues like multiple Points on LineStrings, snapping ends, and curving segments have already been addressed by such tools, but parallel LineStrings, and enclosed Linestrings (eg. round-abouts) still need to be resolved, to name a few. It seems that a categorization of the different topological issues (likely similar to the ones just mentioned) could create a framework from which to approach a final pipeline. However, it is proposed that early tests of different potential avenues be performed to sketch a planning route going forward (one of such tests is exemplified under the Approach section). The ideal solution is expected to be source-agnostic, but also leverage the current efforts already done by the community.\nOverall, the idea is to prioritize work alongside the mentors and the community to focus on increasing the short-term benefits of all PySAL/GeoPandas users (some of whom might already be familiar with some of the other corrections). As the project progresses over different iterative approaches, it is expected to incorporate more performance tests to counterbalance the feasibility of each approach as well as to build the desired autonomy of the tools to be reliant exclusively on input geometries.",

The goal of the project is the full implementation of the VF2++ algorithm, which is an improved version of the original VF2 algorithm, extended to directed and multigraph settings, in a nonrecursive manner. \n\n\nThe brief description of the original algorithm (VF2) is that, after verifying  that both the input graphs have the same number of nodes and the exact same degree sequences, it starts constructing a mapping, between the nodes of the two graphs. If the mapping can be extended such that, every node from the first graph is matched to a node of the second graph, then the two graphs are considered to be Isomorphic.\n\nThe imporved version (VF2++), performs a preprocess, during which, a matching order is found, such that the algorithm is able to recognize the feasibility of the examined branches, avoiding a significant amount of computations by excluding the infeasible ones. \n\nThe plan to solve the problem is the following.\n\nStep 1: \nextensive research, questions asked and ideas discussed with the mentors. Establishment of a clear understanding of the topic is crucial.\n\nStep 2: \nDecomposition of the problem into smaller and more distinct, less complex sub-problems.

          "description": "In Bayesian statistics, one way to circumvent positing parametric assumptions is to use Dirichlet Processes (DP) as priors for probability distributions themselves. PyMC is a Python probabilistic programming library for Bayesian modelling and there are ongoing efforts to add a DP functionality to the package. DPs are daunting both theoretically and computationally as their non-trivial implementation would benefit from polished non-user facing methods in Aesara - formerly Theano - and AePPL. The former provides the computational backend to PyMC whereas AePPL converts arbitrary Aesara graphs into equivalent log-probability graphs which are convenient for automatic differentiation and hence sampling. The goals of my proposed Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project are threefold: relax the univariate assumption of components in mixture models, allow the creation of mixture graph via IfElse and Switch statements and continue ongoing efforts to add a DP functionality to PyMC.",

Oftentimes the visualization of these threats are in terms of color-coded hazard maps, which do not convey the urgency or the threat level to the general public at risk, resulting in loss of life and property. Traditional rendering of simulations are also not feasible when simulating millions of material points being written to a disk at a fixed time interval. CB-Geo MPM offers a scalable parallel system for running regional-scale landslide hazard simulations. In this project, I will develop a regional-scale in-situ visualization technique by coupling the CB-Geo MPM code with the asynchronous distributed ray tracing engine TACC Galaxy.

          "description": "Electromagnetic devices have become ubiquitous in our lives due to their limitless applications. For designing and optimizing such devices, non-uniform and unstructured meshes are essential, due to the multiscale nature of the problem. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is well known for handling such meshes. FEniCSx is an open-source platform for solving partial differential equations with the FEM, offering high-level Python and C++ interfaces. It has become a popular choice among FEM users, especially for solid mechanic and fluid dynamic applications. However, FEniCSx has not met the same popularity for electromagnetic applications due to the lack of comprehensive demos showing how to correctly setup and solve electromagnetic partial differential equations, and therefore many researchers and engineers in this field prefer to use other (often commercial) FEM platforms. This proposal aims to solve this issue by developing extensive and accessible electromagnetic demos for a number of case studies. In particular, the work will focus on delivering at least five demos (plus tests and documentation), regarding 1) the use of complex numbers, the implementation of 2) Scattering Boundary Conditions, 3) Perfectly Matched Layers, and 4) Maxwell's equations for axisymmetric structures, and 5) the parallelization of a parameterized problem with the MPI COMM_SELF communicator.  These additions will be a step towards the extensive use of FEniCSx in the electromagnetic community since they will provide working tools for real-world problems. The demos will also be a show-reel for new features of FEniCSx that have not been covered in past demos or tutorials. A long term effect of this work could be more developers involved in the FEniCSx project, more guiding feedback from end users, and promotion of open source software for electromagnetic/photonic simulations.",

Most of the available Bayesian methods are looking at concentration-responses of genes profile in drug discovery and toxicology. However, temporal analysis is also crucial to be conducted for the identification of causal relationships of the sequence of events about how genes are activated and inhibited including the changepoint that would allow for the evaluation of potential feedback and adaptive responses. Thus, the Project represents an opportunity to contribute to and demonstrate the utility of PyMC following a real-case scenario. For that, we will firstly update the existing implementation by migrating them to Aesara while keeping the same mathematical equations and referencing them accordingly. We will then implement Linear Gaussian State Space modelling and Kalman filter, a discrete-time process, and apply it to a temporal gene-expression dataset to showcase the applicability of PyMC in chemical safety assessment and decision making.\n \nThe main deliverables include:\nD1. Improve and update the published four pymc-examples notebooks on time series \nD2. Write blog posts about informing on the updated implementations\nD3.

This projects aims to create a benchmarking tool that could be run regularly and record results in order to track code efficiency across different QuTiP updates. The two recorded benchmarking metrics would be memory occupation and CPU instruction count (as well as time cost of each instruction) as these are a good proxy for computation runtime without having to take hardware into account.

          "description": "Code coverage is the percentage of code that is executed by automated tests. Code coverage tells us which lines of a project have been executed and which have not. The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure has upwards of 100,000 tests (unit, regression, and test suite) that can be executed with a single make check-all command, and a very large codebase consisting of millions of lines and multiple subprojects such as Clang, MLIR, OpenMP, Polly etc. \n\nIt is therefore natural that some parts of the compiler are better checked by testcases than others. While code coverage cannot tell us if a given test suite is adequate or not; what it can tell us is if the test suite covers all areas of the codebase. Code coverage metrics also give information about line and branch execution counts which in turn can be used for profile guided optimizations. Code coverage can also tell us about the amount of dead code (unreachable code) in LLVM and such code can be removed. Finally, a codebase wide audit may throw up surprising results and lead to some research papers discussing these results. \n\nIn this proposal I describe how we can go about implementing code coverage for the LLVM codebase, how to interface it with tools like LCOV, and how to integrate GitHub actions such that the coverage percentage for each subproject is displayed in the GitHub repository.",

It will also implement a quota system to prevent abuse of computing resources.\nThis will be accomplished by using a predefined SSH connection to the facility. Instead of user holding the private key and moving the public key to the remote submit node, the server holds a database of all remote nodes and for each node it creates a separate public and private key pair.  The public key will be copied to the remote node. The private key would be saved on the server. Whenever an authenticated user tries to connect to a particular submit node in the HPC facility, the private key for that node will be fetched by the server and will be used to authenticate the user against that remote node and there will be no need for the user to configure and enter any private key at all. Thus there will be just one private key for all users of a particular submit node. Server will also keep a tally of all the users that are currently using the server's private key at the moment. This will help implement a quota system to ensure that the resources are not maxed out.\nOver the span of 12 weeks, a customized version of cloud COPASI will be produced that will provide an easy to use interface for UConn users to submit their jobs and get results in quick time.",

The final delivery will contribute to a part of the CGAL surface reconstruction component.",

          "description": "I propose to implement \"imcomplete symlink impletentation\" and \"device tree overlays for robotics cape\".\n\n[Problems and Solutions]\n\nBeagleBone has sold a module called Cape, which connects to the BeagleBoard. This Cape was designed for past BeagleBoard and could not be handled directly by BeagleBoneAI, which has a different SoC. They had created a Cape compatibility layer for the BeagleBoneAI that can use the script for other BeagleBoard like BeaglBboneBlack. \n\nHowever, the current implementation has the following problems. This proposal will address these issues.\n\n* There are symbolic links that do not appear by default in the AI.\nThere are symbolic links that do not yet appear in the device tree. For example, SPI, PWM, and CAN peripherals have no symlink. If you use this device tree as it is, these peripherals are not available in the standard state.\n\nThe work is to create a corresponding udev rule, for example, and put it on the symlink so that it can be handled by BeagleBone AI's file system.\n\nThe symlink we want to create is as follows:\nGPIO (for gpio-leds and gpio-keys),\nPWM,\nSPI,\nCAN,\n\n* Need device tree overlay for Robotics Cape.\nCurrently, Compatible Overlays are available for the various types of Capes offered by BeagleBone. However, no overlays are yet available for the Robotics Cape. These will need to be created.\n\nThe first step is to create a device tree overlay based on Device Tree for Robotics Cape on BeagleBone Black, following the Device Tree Overlay Creation Article\".\n\n* No demo code explaining how to use each Cape.\nCurrently we do not yet have demo code for each Cape to see how it works with the device tree overlay for each Cape. I need to add demo code for each Cape, or otherwise prepare documentation for developers and end users.\n\n[Benefit]\n* A Compatibility Layer for BeagleBone AI will be added, allowing Robotics Cape to be handled by AI.\n* Various tutorials will be added to the Capes to help the user understand how to use it.",

          "description": "Greybus is an application layer for UniPro, communications happen over bidirectional connections between entities. The physical bus is attached to the connected device, running Zephyr. A virtual bus, corresponding to the physical bus on the connected device, is created on the Linux side. The physical and virtual bus functionality appears the same to a user. Greybus is used to exchange bus-specific messages and data between the connected device and Linux. Since Greybus is an application, it can be used over other protocols and buses such as TCP/IP, Bluetooth or UART with the help of GBridge.\n\nThe Linux kernel's IIO subsystem contains drivers for many sensors. Several mikrobus boards do not have kernel drivers, which will have to be written and merged upstream.\n\nThis project aims to support all relevant peripherals on BeagleConnect Freedom on Greybus for Zephyr. This involves adding platform-specific changes to enable these protocols and interfaces to existing NuttX sources. Each peripheral will be tested over a mikrobus add-on board over Greybus using its corresponding driver in the kernel.\n\nMikrobus drivers will be updated to probe device drivers for the new peripherals added automatically. Greybus will also be updated with support for gb-log, which can be used for logging data from remote nodes and gb-loopback, which can be used for greybus transaction throughput testing.\n\nThe Zephyr Project provides a native POSIX target that can run on the host OS without emulation. This eliminates the need for architecture-specific hardware in the early phases of development. This target lacks several features which prevent it from being used in Greybus testing. A goal would be to generate Greybus traffic for testing and fleshing out the native-POSIX target to demonstrate Greybus message handling.",

The BeagleWire is a Lattice iCE40HX FPGA development platform compatible with the Beagleboards.  This project has two goals, to implement a RISC-V based PRU and to improve the reliability of standalone cores on BeagleWire.\n\nA programmable real-time unit (PRU) is a fast (200-MHz, 32-bit) processor providing single-cycle I/O access to peripherals on Beagleboards. PRUs allow for the combination of flexibility of an OS system and the timing of a microcontroller, and are handy to avoid throwing in another device on top of the Beagleboard to control or interface with a new peripheral. Implementing this on an FPGA cape allows the implementation of a open source PRU-like CPU on an open ISA, and also allows for more flexibility, relief CPU and potentially for a better clock frequency trade-offs. In this project, existing RISC-V based implementations FPGA will be explored and adapted for this purpose.\n\nStandalone cores on the BeagleWire cape still suffer from reliability issues. The most notable known issue is with the SDRAM interface working sporadically.  The second goal of the project is to test and improve the reliability of each of the subsystems (SPI, PWM, UART, SDRAM, etc) on the BeagleWire.",

Regenerating bitmaps can take a long time.\n\n4.

Point to point solution is given below - \n\n1. There are better and more modern techniques than EWAH for compressing. Roaring+run bitmap can be used as an alternative to EWAH. So that, we can optimize the performance of compressing/decompression. I will also write performance tests to verify that.\n\nOne possible approach  to problem no. 3, is to add a new mode that only adds new bitmaps for commits introduced between successive bitmap generations.\n\nTo solve problem no. 2, we can create a `table of contents for these bitmaps.

For most embedded processors,  the size of programmable memory is a huge limitation. \r\nMost of the frequently used instructions can be compressed i.e. compiled into 16-bits instead of 32-bits. We can perform a better utilization of memory by adding extra hardware to handle the compressed instructions.\r\nThis project aims to:\r\n* Design the compressed decoder and pre-fetch modules for NucleusRV core for Compressed Instructions support. \r\n* Verify the working of the project using RISC-V Compliance test suit\r\n* Document the complete project and guide on how to integrate the C extension support of RISC-V based cores written in SCALA.",

For instance, family pictures are not meant to be uploaded to Commons. This state will be remembered even after restarting the app. Tapping \"Not for upload\" when all selected pictures are already marked as \"Not for upload\" has the opposite effect, a bit like pressing \"Italic\" twice in a text editor makes the selected text in Italic then normal.\n2. Switch to hide/unhide pictures that are either marked as \"Not for upload\" or have been uploaded already. Hiding them allows the contributor to more easily spot pictures they might want to upload.\n3. Currently, when selecting 3 pictures, they are numbered \"1\", \"2\", \"3\". Instead, please make all numbers always show the number of selected pictures, for instance, if 3 pictures are selected, they should all have the number \"3\", and be uploaded in the same order as their thumbnails are shown.\n4. Add a fast scrollbar (ideally a Bubble scroll showing the date at which the pictures shown were taken).\n\n5. UI when in full-screen mode -fullscreen starts when you long-press any picture in the custom picker\n\n5.1.

Hence, the quality and quantity of the open data offered by Wikidata will increase.\n\n\nI will later try to implement a recommendation engine that suggests agreeable facts to Wikidata editors that are likely to be in their area of expertise. Also, gamification features to show appreciation to Wikidata editors, e.g., a badge Web service allowing users to integrate their score/rank into their profiles on social networks. That will be encouraging for the editors.\n\n\nGoals\n\n(1) Implement Webservice interfaces for data donations, i.e., sets of approvable facts (which should also contain links to evidence, etc.)\n\n(2) Implement a recommendation engine that suggests agreeable facts to Wikidata editors that are likely to be in their area of expertise.\n\n(3) Extend the gamification features to show appreciation to Wikidata editors. Example: a badge Web service allowing users to integrate their score/rank into their profiles on social networks (e.g., on Wikidata’s user page, GitHub profile, Linkedin profile) to show their dedication and activate other users.\n\nImpact\n\n(1) Data donations are possible and at the same time, an efficient approval process is supported.\n\n(2) More fact ingestions with the help of the Wikimedia community.\n\n(3) Faster integration of new facts into Wikidata.",

As the number of conversations and messages increase, maintaining an index on the client side becomes tougher.\n \nThe solution to these problems is a Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) scheme that lets the client safely store an encrypted database on an untrusted server and search through it with full privacy.\n \nThis project will implement, in particular, the keyword search scheme outlined in a Demertzis et al. paper titled “Fast Searchable Encryption with Tunable Locality”. I will achieve this by creating a Python library that exposes methods to create, update and search on encrypted indices stored in content repositories in a Matrix homeserver.\n \nAs a part of the project I will be demonstratively integrating the library into an existing Matrix client.

The main intent of this project would be to highlight the Luna&Cat platform and inspire and guide community members to create their own projects. Within this one project I would actually like to develop three different games on the same virtual pet theme. The purpose of this would be to highlight the varying levels of complexity that are possible on the platform - the concept of \"low floor, high ceiling\".\n\nThese are the main areas I would consider while designing the game:\n- Easily modifiable/remixable and customizable - ideally, the project would have a community component and invite members of the Catrobat community to create their own virtual pet games\n- Run well on mobile devices - the game should deliver a mobile-first experience\n- Suitability for a variety of ages and stages - the three different tiers of complexity would make the tutorials more accesible to coders of different levels \n- High appeal - I know that members of the Catrobat community adore cats and other animals very much. I would ensure delightful art, designs and sounds are a core component!\n- Within the tutorials - provide rich documentation and troubleshooting solutions so that members of the Catrobat community will be able to create their own games. This would likely take on the form of Wiki articles and possibly video tutorials. \n\nDeliverables: \n- Three virtual pet collector games (for beginner, intermediate and advanced coders respectively)\n\t- Art and assets\n- Tutorials and documentation for each game",

Implementing a project merging feature will greatly improve the experience for pocket code users when it comes to building even more powerful applications and games. I've divided the problem into the following 5 milestones, with their subtasks to achieve: 1. Merging Projects Components with existing, simple conflicting variables protocol: 1.1 Merging Multiple Sprites 1.2 Merging Scenes 2. Implementing a Manual Conflict-Handler Interface: 2.1 User Interface for Merging Dialog: (choosing which conflict to merge, option to abort merge etc.) 2.2 Handling Local & Global Variable Conflicts 2.3 Handling Script Conflicts: View of Conflicting Scripts, Choose One 2.4 Handling Looks & Sounds Conflicts: Duplication User chooses 2.5 Handling Equal Sprites 2.6 Handling Equal Scenes 3. Merging options for UI 3.1 Abort Merge 3.2 Automatic Merge Without Conflict Search ( may not import everything) 3.3 Manual Merge ( Powerful Merge every conflict needs to be resolved) 4. Device specific configurations 4.1 Handling Screen Size & Resolution sensitive variables 4.2 Handling Screen Size & Resolution sensitive bricks 5. Merging Remix Graph 5.1 Implementing project merge history Each feature will be implemented using Kotlin or Java depending on source code files affected by changes, and each feature should be well tested.",

While the CLI is very powerful and user friendly, it should be used by power users (release team who installs and manages jenkins x clusters). We should not expect developers who are concerned with only the pipelines to install the cli (This does not scale when you have 100+ developers in the company) We do have a UI/dashboard, but it is read only, so users cannot use it to trigger release pipelines or stop running pipelines. In addition, we do not have an audit trail of who did what. So, we propose a new UI/dashboard which has feature parity with the CLI (including SSO and RBAC) The UI should make the JX cli redundant, and add more value to the user with easily available status and logs of the entire cluster",

          "description": "Until today, playing games has become an activity loved by many, mainly due to the fun and competitiveness offered to those who play them. In Liquid Galaxy, a few games were developed that are supported by the cluster system, such as the Galaxy Pong, Galaxy Snake and more, in which lots of them were based on old famous games.\nOne of the first major hits of arcade games was Asteroids, released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field and the objective of the game is to increase the score by shooting and destroying the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' shot. The game gets harder as new asteroids spawn.\n\nFollowing this logic, the project's idea is to remake the original Asteroids game, with a modern design and new features, such as the multiplayer mode. It would be really nostalgic and fun to be able to play it again, especially for those who played it back in the 80's and 90's. Moreover, due to its complexity, uniqueness and system support, the project may be a part of the Liquid Galaxy demonstration, bringing more emphasis to the lab.",

It allows us to set properties for OGC services. \n\tThe problem statement thus asks to create a web frontend to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) the JSON settings with a REST API on top of faroe API. I will try to develop a user-friendly UI for the same and make sure CRUD operations are carried out properly through UI, making it extensible and customizable. Also I’ll try to surely implement the optional extension mentioned in the problem statement.",

It also has inbuilt RAM which can hold 64 CAN messages. There is a loopback support also, which can be used for debugging purposes. By adding driver support for CAN modules, will enable the use of this potential hardware. With the help of the Am335x reference manual, TI’s starterware firmware and CAN specification I could understand the initialization and working of the CAN module. With the help of existing RTEMS supported CAN drivers I could understand the CAN framework and develop the support for CAN modules for BBB in RTEMS.\nAm335x has 8 ADC channels (with 7 channels accessible in BBB through pinouts) with 12 bit resolution. The freeBSD has ADC driver support for BBB, So we can port this driver to rtems-libbsd.\nI chose this project because I started learning embedded systems from BeagleBone Black and developed firmware from scratch with few peripherals and shell support https://github.com/slpp95prashanth/Beaglebone-mBootloader/tree/cpsw.

And for the Android implementation, I will be using Java and Android-specific XML.\n\nFirstly, in the main desktop client- the features of blockers would be included in the settings menu along with a simple feature switch. Pre-configured blocking lists would be shipped with each release. This would help us in filtering out the DNS requests and blocking the IPs in our target blocking list.\nI will package the entire solution in a self-contained Go Library that will be able to read packages from a given file descriptor and work accordingly.\n\nFuture Scope includes implementation in iOS environment and  implementing update mechanism.",

          "description": "Gnuastro is primarily written in C because astronomical datasets are large and thus need to be efficient with few dependencies. Therefore, its most commonly used interface are Gnuastro’s command-line programs. However, Gnuastro’s also has an extensive set of installed, dynamic C/C++ libraries, which are the actually beating heart of the programs. On the other hand, many projects today are done in Python, almost excuslively using Numpy for their numerical operations (like data arrays). \nPython and Numpy are actually written in C, therefore they have very well-defined interfaces for communicating with installed C libraries, using CPython. Since both Gnuastro and Numpy's core data structure are very similar, we plan on building a converter between the two. This will make it possible to perform all data operations using Numpys C-API. This will be followed by adding a low-level wrapper infra-structure which will allow easy usage of Gnuastro’s powerful libraries in Python.\nThus, the final goal is to have Gnuastro be an importable module in Python (just like Numpy) and have all the inner data operations of Gnuastro be performed using Numpy's C-API.",

          "description": "Stingray is a python package that provides a common platform for time series analysis of X-ray data to the astronomy community. One important aspect of time series analysis of astronomical sources is to identify and characterize their variability from their light curves. The light curves of these sources are affected by spurious variability from variable backgrounds and gaps due to occultation or inaccessibility of the source. This causes data to be affected by Poissonian uncertainties. In the case of sources that are near to detection limit of telescope, these uncertainties are dominant.\n\nBayesian Excess Variance (Bexvar) is a statistical method to measure variability in Poisson-distributed data. The method has been developed to analyze X-Ray light curves of faint sources observed by eROSITA telescope. Bexvar is a Bayesian formulation of the excess variance method.\n\nThe aim of this project is to implement this method in Stingray, create test cases for the method based on real observational data and write appropriate documentation.",

Currently, the documentation website is being powered by numerous Markdown files which are being rendered into a static website with the help of Docusaurus. \n\nThe challenge is to find and implement a way to generate documentation (in the form of static HTML files) from comments within the files, which can then be hosted on the site used for documentation.

The two features that are planned to be implemented are solving Torsional problems due to the presence of torque along the direction of the shaft and calculating internal forces & reactions for a given Truss under external forces and moments. This project also plans to add some functions to the geometry module to add some flexibility to the way one can form composite shapes so that it is easier to define complex cross-sectional geometries for the beam module.

Most of the time, however, a designer will not require exact values for circuit specs, but rather any value in a certain range. With a design space exploration (DSE) optimization technique, one can find what specific value inside these ranges the circuit parameters need to have in order to optimize a certain metric, such as power consumption. For this, two possibilities are explored: using black-box optimization from Google Cloud's Vertex AI or a self-hosted implementation with Open Source Vizier. An adaptation of the application's code, today proposed as a CLI tool, to redirect it as a Python package is also in the scope of the project.

          "description": "Kolibri Studio is a content curation tool for Kolibri. Its main purpose is to provide an\neasy and convenient way to organize learning resources and build channels for Kolibri.\nUser Experience is a really important aspect of Kolibri Studio as it may involve multiple\nusers working on the same content curation unit (channels). Delayed reflection of the\nmodified state of a channel to a collaborative user may cause inconvenience and may even lead to repetitive change to the same entity.\n\nThe current setup for Real-Time Communication in Studio involves maintaining a\nserver-side log which is being simulated by calling the POST method of sync API. All\ncollaborative users are hitting this POST method at regular intervals to post any changes made by them (if no changes are made then the empty changes array is posted) and receive any changes made by other users as a response of this method.\n\nThe proposed WebSocket architecture will neutralize and reduce the load on the server which is currently being created due to continuous polling of the APIs. It will convert the complex underlying structure of Sync API into a simple real-time-friendly architecture in which a full-duplex communication between client and server takes place. It will also enormously enhance the user experience of the whole process of collaborative content curation.",

This is not as easy as it sounds, as we need to factor in various pitfalls such as what happens when there's not enough RAM to hold the temporary compressed buffer for example.\n\nDeliverables would be an extensible way to load and save Z compressed files, an exhaustive unit test suite, which will test file detection, graphic loading, pitfall handling behavior and ready made test files.",

          "description": "For GHC 9.2.x to achieve more widespread adoption, tooling will need to support its best features. For years users have been frustrated by Haskell's conspicuous lack of support for namespacing features common in other languages. Haskell provides a limited form of namespacing with qualified imports, but using it to namespace field selectors tends to require hacky file structures. Fortunately, Haskell now provides `DuplicateRecordFields`, and GHC 9.2 introduced the `OverloadedRecordDot` language extension. These together provide a cleaner and more ergonomic interface for working with record types, a step towards better namespace support in Haskell.\n\nHLS already supports record dot-syntax to a small extent. For example, in the line `y = x.a`, type information is available when hovering over `y` or `x`. To unlock the full potential of this syntax though, HLS users should be able to \"dot into\" the record to see its fields, enabling IDE-driven API exploration. Additionally, type information for the `.a` part should be available to the user on hover. These are the main features I propose to add to HLS for this project.",

          "description": "The architecture of the GHC compiler in its current state is anti-modular. Designed with GHC-the-program as the sole consumer in mind, it is very difficult for newer tooling to reuse its components. These problems extend to the inclusion of new backends such that implementations for various target platforms forked GHC frequently.\n\nThe first step to improving the current design is the isolation of the different components and separation the codebase in layers for different purposes, described in the classic book \"Domain Driven Design\". This is already partly done, and in this project I join the existing effort by working on the next remaining subsystem: GHC's Core pipeline.\n\nIn order to achieve my goal, I will proceed by using an incremental bottom-up approach: Starting at the bottom of the module hierarchy, I will push references to upper layers module-by-module up in the callstack until they are completely removed from each component. For the entry points of each in-scope component, I will then provide component-specific configuration types and corresponding initialization functions. The in-scope components are specific configurable tasks of the optimizer, and the optimizer as a whole.\n\nWith this work completed, there will be significantly less references to the ubiquitous global states used throughout the whole compiler, namely the DynFlags and the HscEnv type, and significantly fewer imports of modules from upper layers, e.g. the driver.",

          "description": "The proposed project aims at establishing a port between GHC and [MMTk](https://www.mmtk.io/) -- an external memory management toolkit that provides languages with a set of memory management primitives and garbage collectors. \n\nThe current existing GHC storage manager (GHCSM) has a sophisticated generational GC; However, it's also optimized and integrated into GHC's runtime, making it difficult to switch to a broader range of collectors. It would be beneficial to generalize GHC's runtime, make it separable from GHCSM, and connect it with a suite of different garbage collections from MMTk.\n\n\nTo achieve this goal, we propose to:\n1. Refactor GHC's runtime system to more effectively abstract over storage management operations;\n2. Introduce a storage management backend using MMTk's trivial no-GC collection plan;\n3. Integrate write barriers necessary for generational collection with MMTk;\n4. Introduce support for MMTk's semi-space and mark-sweep GC plans.",

At the moment, final paper submissions to NBDT are in LaTeX format. While there are tools that provide LaTeX to XML conversion (as required by PMC), no single tool does it seamlessly without errors for the template corresponding to NBDT. The current project aims to build an application providing this functionality. The project will build over the LaTeXML tool to enhance custom bindings as required for NBDT submissions. The first step would be to enhance the bindings for body matter, as Scholastica (which hosts NBDT) already provides it for front-matter binding. In addition, to make the application platform-independent, it will be extended to provide custom front-matter and back-matter bindings. It shall also contribute verification engines to automate XML verification, JATS verification, and PMC-specific verification. The application shall make it convenient to bridge NBDT submissions and the PMC archival process.",

With that said, this project aims to (i) convert a publically available dataset into NWB format, (ii) ensure NWB datasets' compatibility with NWB explorer (NWBE), (iii) and facilitate generality of the conversion process by investigating the sources of NWBE-NWB incompatibilities and ensuring essential metadata being added.

This project will enable clinical neurophysiologists to upload EEG data in standardized formats; annotate data with artifacts, such as electrical noise and movement artifacts, using a novel ontology that is interoperable with the Hierarchical Event Descriptors specification; and export this data to the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard. While the resulting libraries of this project will be integrated into a Progressive Web Application for clinical neurophysiologists, they will also be released standalone as tools to further facilitate the development of neuroscience tools on the Open Web.

          "description": "Several attempts have been made in recent years to develop, collect\nand analyze data in the field of neuroscience.\nThis proposal aims at helping neuroscience and open-source communities by refactoring and optimizing Disimpy’s code. With this optimization, simulation runtimes and GPU memory usage could be reduced, achieving a higher precision in DW-MRI simulations, which could bring us closer to the real and complex behavior of the system that shapes brain tissue.\nDisimpy is a GPU-accelerated diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance simulator that is used for developing and validating neuroimaging methods.\nDiffusion MRI is an imaging modality that provides us with information such as the orientation, the size, or the shape of neurons from the random displacements of water molecules in brain tissue. Water molecule diffusion patterns show how the molecules interact with the environment, revealing microscopic details about tissue structure, either sane or impaired.\nDiffusion MRI simulations require high precision to represent reality meticulously. Hence, optimizing the code that runs the simulation seems reasonable and extremely important. This study sheds light on this issue by proposing examples on how to improve the code, such as an optimization of Subvoxel-Triangle intersection algorithm, Ray-Triangle intersection algorithm, and the way of saving triangles and an implementation of a new feature that could allow the simulation of more complex systems.",

          "description": "Biologically detailed models are useful tools in neuroscience, and automated methods are now routinely applied to construct and validate such models based on the relevant experimental data. The open-source parameter fitting software Neuroptimus (formerly Optimizer) was developed to enable the straightforward application of advanced parameter optimization methods (such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence) to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms including PCs and supercomputers. Neuroptimus currently uses various built-in cost functions and those implemented by the eFEL feature extraction library to compare the behavior of the models to the (experimental) target data. However, this approach severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by the optimization. On the other hand, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors.\n\nThe aim of the current project is to extend the open-source neural parameter optimization tool Neuroptimus so that it is able to use test scores from the SciUnit framework as the cost function during optimization. Direct applications would include the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons using a combination of Neuroptimus and HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Implement changes in the Neuroptimus core so that it is able to use SciUnit test scores as cost functions during optimization\n2. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that arbitrary combinations of built-in cost functions, eFEL features, and SciUnit test scores can be used\n3. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that the new features become accessible from the graphical user interface\n4.

Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic cameras, are bio-inspired imaging sensors that work differently to traditional cameras in that they measure pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously instead of capturing images at a fixed rate. Since the way event cameras capture data is fundamentally different to traditional cameras, novel methods are required to process the output of these sensors. In addition to dealing with ways for capturing data with event cameras, event-based vision encompasses techniques to process the captured data - events - as well, including learning-based techniques and models, spiking neural networks (SNNs) being an example.\n\nThis project aims to create benchmark datasets for object recognition tasks with event-based cameras. Using machine learning solutions for such tasks requires a sufficiently large and varied collection of data. The primary goal of this project is to develop Python utilities for augmenting event camera recordings of objects captured in an academic setting in various ways to create benchmark datasets. A secondary goal of this project is to test the performance of spiking neural networks for object recognition on the created datasets.",

          "description": "Conducting Cognitive Neuroscience Experiments has always been limited to research-grade EEG devices that cost tens of thousands of dollars. Since the conception of cheaper alternatives like MUSE, OpenBCI, etc - there have been an influx of consumer grade EEGs that allow the general public to have access to such devices. \nHowever, there is a lack of a standard and easy to use library to conduct and reproduce research on these devices. EEG - Notebooks provides the necessary software required to pull together the various enabling technologies necessary for running these experiments and analyzing the data. This can open dramatic new possibilities for both neurotech and cognitive neuroscience education, as well as more ambitious and large-scale research and clinical applications using large numbers of devices and or more naturalistic (out-of lab) settings. This leads towards the larger goal of contributing to the democratization of the cognitive neuroscience experimental world. \nIn its current state, the source code for the EEG-Notebooks experiment library is limited by its overly repeated and non-generalized code. This project seeks to tackle that issue by using classes and Inheritance to make the code easier to read, more extendable to the open source community, and a better experience for the general user.

The brain imaging data structure format is a widely-adopted framework for disseminating clean datasets for use in the reproducibility of neuroimaging data analyses (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). This project would aid in this pursuit by establishing built-in support for the BIDS format within the Pydra software package. Pydra is a library that allows complete control of the command line through Python (e.g., within a Jupyter Notebook). The majority of brain imaging data is analyzed using many commands that operate in a serial manner for cleaning, aligning, and applying statistical models to the data often in batches. Rather than relying on shell scripting and manual documentation of software versions, commands used, and outputs that are generated, Pydra can do so automatically. Pydra not only allows commands to be run through Python that would normally be run within the command line, but also unlocks the ability to interface with any CLI binaries a user might have installed as third party tools. Beyond this, Pydra allows the development of ‘workflows’ or stepwise processing pipelines with traceable software and command provenance, allowing an individual to essentially run an exact analysis in a “frozen” environment that the original publisher/researcher/scientist used themselves.",

          "description": "It often becomes taxing for editors to assign reviewers to a paper in journals, simply because of the vast number of potential reviewers, or even if it’s confusing to understand their areas of research.\n\nThis project aims to tackle exactly that by providing automation for the step, i.e. inviting and assigning reviewers for a manuscript.\nThe goal of the project is to build an independent web platform to assign reviewers to articles, provided their abstract/the paper. The editors simply need to provide the abstract of the paper or the paper URL, and the output is a sorted list of potential reviewers.\nApart from speeding up the workflow of choosing the reviewers for the paper, this approach also promises to minimise the bias introduced during reviewer selection- The algorithm would be optimised to account for potential conflicts of interest between any of the authors and the reviewers while assigning reviewers.",

          "description": "PyGeNN is a Python package for simulating spiking neural networks using GPUs. For this project, I will construct and simulate a PyGeNN model of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) by reproducing the point-neuron V1 model created by Billeh et al. (2020). Taking advantage of GPU-acceleration, the PyGeNN model will be able to simulate V1 neural activity in real time. \n\nI will first implement a generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (GLIF) neuron class, which will govern the spiking behavior of neurons during simulation. Next, I will construct the network by connecting V1, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and background (BKG) neurons, using the parameters calculated by Billeh et al. (2020). To validate the model, I will compare the results of PyGeNN simulations to those of BMTK/NEST simulations. Finally, I will construct an application that simulates V1 activity in response to a webcam stream in real time. If time permits, I will enhance this application by implementing a GPU-accelerated implementation of the filternet LGN model, which will increase the maximum frame rate that can be simulated in real time. \n\nThe results of this project will include: (1) a complete model of mouse V1, (2) validation results and benchmark comparisons to BMTK/NEST simulations, (3) a webcam application showing simulated neural activity in real time, and (4) if time permits, a GPU-accelerated implementation of the filternet model.",

But they have been missing coroutine (co_await) integration and minor functionalities as described in P2300 which is likely to be accepted. Hence I propose to implement these functionalities within the Core HPX Library.\n\nBenefits:\n* Coroutines introduce better async code. For example, it is more readable, local variables have the same lifespan as the coroutine which means we don’t need to worry about allocation/release.\n* S/R algorithms can work with coroutines which they cannot as of now unless relied on futures which as mentioned are single-time use.\n* Adding co_await support makes the code more structured with respect to concurrency which can also be done by library abstractions of callbacks but using co_await may make it more optimized.",

Using Simulink code generation tools to add a custom attitude controller to the ArduPilot will allow the researcher to test their novel control algorithm in ArduPilot without spending too much time in manual coding which will further increase ArduPilot usage in academia. \n\nCurrently, ArduPilot does not have a short and concise way to implement and test custom controllers. This project’s main aim is to create a systematic and sustainable way to implement a custom controller into ArduPilot using Simulink code generation and set an example for other researchers on how to use ArduPilot as a control system development platform. \n\nI implemented a new controller in the ArduCopter and has a Simulink model of this controller, thus I will continue with this vehicle type. But the methods laid during this project should be transferable to the other vehicle types. There are multiple-step I identified to achieve this goal. Firstly, the ArduCopter attitude controller code structure needs to be changed to allow running custom controller concurrently and safely switching between two-controller. Second, a hook in ArduCopter for Simulink code generation to bind should be created. Third, human-readable source code from Simulink without any dependencies on the Matlab libraries should be generated. Fourth, prepare a Matlab script to automatically merge generated libraries into ArduCopter source code, and configure and build it. Last, prepare detailed documentation and video to show how to utilize this functionality.",

They are as follows.\n\n -> Displaying count of contents of a directory in the size column  \n\nCurrently, the value under the size column for directories are left blank. The aim is to enable a feature, that\nshows the count of folders/files within a directory under the size column, which the user can toggle from the\ncolumn editor. We have a WIP patch to work upon.\n\n-> Add the option to expand folders in “Details View”\n\nCurrently, upon entering a folder, details-view lists all the contents of a folder without the ability to expand\nthe contents of each folder on the same view. This project seeks to enable the expansion of folders on the\nsame view. This will allow the user to quickly list the files/folders within a directory without needing to\ndescend into a folder. The user would thus, be able to retain a better sense of position while working on a\ndirectory.\n\n-> Add User profiles to XFCE Terminal and rewrite its preferences dialog\n\nThis project seeks to enable user profiles in XFCE Terminal. Currently, all the settings for the terminal are global. Any changes made to the settings will reflect on all the open windows and tabs.\n\nUser profiles enable the user to store a particular set of settings as a preset which can be easily retrieved and applied (preferably using hotkeys) to a given terminal instance of their choice.\n\nThe preference dialog was built using glade. Glade is, in general, unpleasant to work with which has led a lot of other Xfce apps to build their UI through code. Additionally, this makes it difficult to embed the XfceShortcutsEditor into the dialog.\n\nSince, the preference dialog would need to be redesigned for this project, manually rewriting the dialog in C would have the added benefit of embedding XfceShortcutsEditor.",

          "description": "Currently, Casbin uses golang built-in map structure to maintain policies in the main memory and persist the policies via adapter abstraction.\n\nIf policies data grows, however, the growing cost of main memory resources and bad performance make the memory management strategy not tolerable anymore. We need to find a better way to manage the casbin in-memory data when data grows.\n\nFrom my point of view, our main goal is to reduce the cost of memory as well as keep good performance handling policies read and write requests.\n\nIn order to achieve those key goals, we can introduce an experimental tuple storage to get charge of storing those policies, turning the policies management strategy from memory-oriented to disk-oriented. We can even make a better abstraction of the storage layer so that we can use different engines (row, column) for the different workloads.\n\nIn general, we can take the following parts into consideration to achieve our goals.  \n    1. API for upper layer.\n    2. workload optimizer. \n    3. Buffer Pool management.\n    4. Indexing.\n    5. Data Storage Structures.\n    6.

Casdoor is a centralized authentication / Single-Sign-On (SSO) platform.\nProblem: \n1. A more friendly policy management UI is needed for Casbin-dashboard. And it should be able to handle 10,000+ more rules. 2. Test management page needs to be developed for Casbin-dashboard. A test page to make example requests to Casbin and get responses, like Postman. 3. Authentication and authorization for the Casbin-dashboard itself. Of course authorization will be implemented in Casbin. 4. Casdoor needs to sign up with email without verification by configuring the application edit page. 5. Casdoor needs to support configurable captcha in user flows. It can support different implementations.\nSolution:\n1. We can use more powerful and high-quality UI libraries such as Ant Design to build more friendly web UI. And in order to handle 10,000+ more rules, we can use paging display and virtual list in frontend, and we can use paging query and database index in backend. 2. We can build a test management page, so that we can create and edit our unit test case through the web page. 3. We can build an authorization management page to realize the authorization of the dashboard. We can use Casbin models to control the presentation of every element on the page and control each request of the RESTful API. 4. We can add a rule to control whether the email verification is required.5. We can integrate the different services from cloud captcha providers like gCaptcha, hCaptcha. To save a lot of work, we just only need to integrate the wrapper code.\nDeliverables:\n1. Allow to sign up with Email without verification for Casdoor. - June 7; \n2. Support configurable captcha for Casdoor. - June 28; \n3. A more friendly policy management UI for Casbin-dashboard. - July 11; \n4. Test management page for Casbin-dashboard. - July 23; \n5. Authentication and authorization for the Casbin-dashboard itself. - Aug 11;",

          "description": "VLC’s 4.0 redesign on the Mac has clearly seen many of the same changes as its counterpart for Linux and Windows, but with a more native-feeling UI on macOS. However, there are also hints that this UI requires some additional work before the release and that this proposal could assist with.\n\nVLC on macOS, for example, does not quite look like other macOS applications yet, though it’s obvious that this is an objective of the Mac team. Navigation does not work the same way as other AppKit applications and is structured in an unconventional manner. Additionally, there are visual divergences from the Apple HIG. The proposal contains visual examples of this.\n\nThis proposal therefore seeks to assist in the redesign of the macOS UI for VLC by altering the aspects of the current implementation that clash with established human interface guidelines in macOS applications. Specifically, this proposal suggests:\n\n1. A redesign of the playlist to resemble collapsible sidebars used in other macOS applications (such as the Music app’s playlist sidebar)\n\n2. Changes to navigation elements within main views, such as the aforementioned double tab bar\n\n3. Attention to detail and ensuring visual polish (correct alignment of elements, proper use of separators and view coloration to distinguish between parts of the app\n\nLastly, the current nightly version of the VLC player lacks the ability to control playback, volume, etc. from the video reproduction window. A set of playback controls such as QuickTime’s, which are inconspicuous and relocatable, would be a great addition to VLC and would make the transition for QuickTime users seamless. There would still be opportunities here for VLC’s branding to come through, mainly with the use of accent colours.",

          "description": "Print Dialogs are one of the most used features for many people, and it is important that they stay up to date with the current print technologies (like CUPS) and be able to quickly adopt any new such upcoming technology (XYZ Cloud Printing Service). The print technology developers should also be able to fix any bugs as soon as they are found. However, since most Print Dialogs are provided natively by the GUI toolkits (and in some cases applications like LibreOffice and Chrome), this is often not the case. This is because the GUI toolkits themselves are large projects with long release cycles, and they have a lot of other similarly important things to work on.\n\nAs of current, most GUI toolkits like GTK and QT connect their Print Dialogs directly with the print technologies like CUPS which creates problems for both. Any changes made by the print technologies, be it a bug fix or a new feature release often takes a long time to show up in the print dialogs upstream due to the reason mentioned before. Similarly, the print technologies need to constantly maintain backwards compatibility since they can’t release breaking changes if the Print Dialogs have not yet implemented them. Besides this, there is also a disconnect between the two sides due to the slow-release cycles.\n\nThe Common Print Dialog Backends (CPDB) introduced in 2017 by Till Kamppeter aims to de-couple the GUI from the print technologies. Instead of directly connecting to each print technologies separately, the GUI projects only must adopt CPDB support once, and then OpenPrinting (or any upcoming cloud printing projects) takes care of the CPD Backend for the print technologies to be up to date with any changes. This way print technologies can react quickly and not be bound by the big GUI toolkits’ inertia.\n\n\nThis project will attempt to get CPDB into print dialogs upstream for GTK, Qt and Chrome.",

The most prevalent communication protocol for driverless scanning is eSCL, which is also used by AirPrint. eSCL is the HTTP-based protocol that Apple employs for AirScan, which is accessible on all multi-function printers that also support AirPrint and is meant to facilitate scanning from Apple's iOS-enabled mobile devices. The specifications of eSCL are not published, however as an HTTP-based protocol, it was not difficult for the creators of eSCL-related applications to reverse-engineer. With these apps already in place, we will port them to PAPPL and build tests for them.",

Since PPD has limitations, therefore, the Application will do away with PPD files internally by making the mentioned libraries function calls. \n\nThis project aims to build a Printer Application for GutenPrint which will not only do away with internal PPD files but also help to display a flexible UI for the printer capabilities. \n\nDeliverables:-\n\n1)A Printer Application for GutenPrint based on PAPPL and libgutenprint library will be developed.\n2)All the options and parameters of the GutenPrint driver will be accessible from the Printer Application’s Web Interface.\n3)The Printer Application will be available in the Snap Store with added description for the users.\n4)Write documentation for the Printer Application for the users.\n\nPlan of Action:-\n\nAt first, I will learn about the PAPPL, Gutenprint driver, and libgutenprintlib library.

          "description": "Scala Native is an ahead-of-time and prevalent compiler for Scala. The traditional compilation is to compile Scala into Java Virtual Machine(JVM) bytecodes, which are executed by JVM. Scala Native compiles Scala into LLVM intermediate representation(LLVM IR) rather than JVM bytecodes. This property decreases the overhead of JVM and improves compilation performance. However, one of the most criticized aspects of Scala Native is its slow compilation efficiency and long build time, especially for large projects. Therefore, the optimization of Scala Native is urgently needed. The aim of this project is to build benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the Scala Native linker, and explore feasible solutions to accelerate the building task of Scala Native. Three aspects are going to be exploited: speeding up the optimizer, introducing incremental compilation, and changing the compilation and linking procedure. As a result, we expect to create benchmarks for evaluating the performance of Native Scala, and to reduce the build time by at least 20%.",

Jensen’s research group (https://github.com/jensengroup/xyz2mol) and integrate it into the RDKit alongside wrappers. The program will be able to convert the atomic coordinates and charge of an organic molecule presented as an xyz file to an RDKit molecule object. Once the tool is equipped, RDKit users will have another way to construct a molecule.\n\nThe core work of the project will involve working on reimplementation of the Python programs function's. The main two steps of the program are 1) deriving atomic connectivities from coordinates and 2) determining the most favorable bond ordering from atomic connectivities. Atomic connectivities are found using either the Huckel method or through consideration of van der Waals radii. Favorable bond ordering is determined by considering different possible valences. The project is hence split up into these subparts. Bond ordering, atomic connectivity, formal charges, and the molecule’s conformation, among a few other factors, are combined to create an RDKit mol object.",

          "description": "Wireless communication and in particular WiFi networks are becoming more and more important. Research already focuses on improving reliability, performance of such networks and also efficiency of the underlying hardware. One promising candidate for improvements is TX-Power Control (TPC). Adjusting the transmit power per packet basically promises improvements in overall throughput in wireless networks and/or the efficiency by improved resource allocation in wireless networks.\nDated back to 2007, Atheros IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n chipsets driven by ath5k and ath9k Linux drivers did first and Mediatek joined recently with hardware support for tx-power control. Those also allow access to set the tx-power per packet, but yet do not provide a driver interface for this. Unfortunately, also the mac80211 subsystem, which is responsible for WiFi communication in the Linux kernel, does not provide an appropriate API to support TPC and per-packet annotation of tx-power.\n\nThe goal of this project is to implement the missing three-tier software parts: (1) mac80211 structs to annotate tx-power levels per packet, (2) mac80211 structs to account tx-power status information once transmitted and (3) a transmit power control (TPC) API for TPC algorithms. This is achieved by developing and implementing the required structs in the mac80211 subsystem, modifying  Linux WiFi drivers to make use of this API, and testing and validating the implementation in several experiments.",

A notable example of such a rate control algorithm is Minstrel HT, the default for Linux-based OpenWRT access points. In Linux, the rate control is handled in the mac80211 kernel subsystem. As such, the development of rate control algorithms is restricted to the kernel space which includes Minstrel HT.

          "description": "Industry Foundation Class (IFC) is the leading open data format for the built environment, based on the ISO 16739-1:2018 standard. It’s the foundation of the openBIM workflow. Today, IFC is most often used as a software-agnostic way of exchanging building information, but there is increasing interest in using the IFC schema as the native format for working with BIM data.\n\n\nBlender, with its mature modelling and rendering capabilities, has the potential to become a powerful BIM authoring tool. Open data and integrated python console already give many options for customising the data and meta data of any geometric object. The BlenderBIM plugin introduces the possibility to assign the properties of IFC classes to native blender geometry and export correctly structured IFC files through the use of the IfcOpenShell software library that already contains many useful functions to work with the IFC schema.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a plugin for the visual scripting language for Blender, Sverchok, that would enable creating IFC geometry and data through the visual programming nodes, allowing the users to create their own parametric workflows and incorporate IFC data directly into their design process.\n\n\nAn equivalent plugin for Sverchok, would allow an integrated parametric design and native IFC workflow to be completed fully inside the FOSS environment. It would also be a strong foundation for integrations with other Building Performance Simulations (BPS) tools. Integration and porting of the nodes to FreeCAD would also be possible.\n\n\nSome of the basic nodes are already coded under the IfcSverchok project. The work will involve testing the existing nodes and writing many more to support the full use case. Since the IFC schema is very large, and often difficult to grasp for new users, emphasis will be on integrating the concepts of IFC into a typical design process in a natural manner and communicating the relevant information comprehensively to the user.",

FLINT-UI is purely focused on UI development while FLINT Reporting is a full-stack service. The Community Website is a front for publishing initiatives, blogs, case studies, and more. Flint-JSON is used to create projects from the predefined set of JSON files.\n\nAs all the UI projects are built during different times and by different authors, they all have a different variety of design patterns, user interfaces, styles, and approaches. It has led to inconsistencies in the UI of mojaglobal projects and as an organization, all the projects that are coming under it must have a common theme and design to ensure user interest.\n\nAlso whenever a new project starts the developer has to make all the components by himself/herself from the start, and if in the future one component has to be changed then we will have to change it in each project if we do not have UI Library.\n\nAll these things will be achieved by developing a faster, lightweight, user-friendly, mobile-friendly, and cross-browser-compatible UI library as a stand-alone dependency for moja global projects.\n\nI welcome this opportunity to work on building a UI Library for moja global. I like the idea of building a UI library having pre-written or ready-made code for various widely used components across all the repositories of moja global that future developers and users can use in their projects just by installing the package and running two or three import commands.",

          "description": "Premature birth is highly prevalent with every one in ten births being premature. A common complication in premature birth is hypothermia (the baby cannot regulate its body temperature). Low-middle income settings limit access to neonatal incubators and radiant warmers. Thus, there arises a need to develop low-cost solutions to support premature newborns in their early and vulnerable stages of life. KMC (Kangaroo Mother Care) is a technique widely practiced to provide thermal support to newborns. During KMC, a caregiver maximizes contact with the newborn by laying the newborn, skin-to-skin on their chest. Since KMC is a highly burdening activity, the caregiver might need breaks for personal care making the baby vulnerable to a loss of a thermal source. The patented NeoWarm device is a low-cost solution to this problem. It not only augments the natural KMC session by providing extra heat but also regulates and monitors the temperature of a newborn even when the caregiver-newborn dyad is not engaged in KMC (standalone mode). The NeoRoo app provides a digital interface to the NeoWarm device by monitoring the vitals of the baby over BLE and sending alerts to responsible medical professionals and parents if the baby's vitals are found to be abnormal. It also establishes a mode of communication between the medical professionals and the guardians of the baby so that there are shared goals, coordinated tasks along with exchange of information for better neonatal care.",

OWID uses a range of choropleth maps, but size-scaled maps have downsides, primarily because human visual perception associates areas with importance.

For tutorials, Codelabs is also used. While extremely handy for smaller projects and initial versions of Keptn, this toolchain has serious deficiencies for larger-scale projects like Keptn.\n\nI am going to propose a New Documentation Site Engine that will be based on Docusaurus. Docusaurus is an optimized site generator in React. Docusaurus helps you to move fast and write content. Build documentation websites, blogs, marketing pages, and more.\n\nThe main focus of Keptn New Documentation Site Engine will be managing large-scale documentation and complex documentation projects. So two major things which are needed in the documentation engine are Multiple repository docs support and Versioning of Docs support.\n\nFind my detailed GSoC 2022 Project Proposal at https://github.com/iamrajiv/GSoC-2022/blob/main/GSoC_2022_Project_Proposal.md.",

          "description": "The basic features in an Election DApp are user registration, election creation, voting and result calculation. To make our DApp more flexible and user friendly, we need to add more voting algorithms apart from General Voting Algorithm. The three important features that need to be implemented are 1) Open and Invite based elections. 2) Authentication and user KYC. 3) Multiple algorithms to conduct elections. To implement these features, I would first work on the algorithms which will be written in Solidity. The front-end part will use Reactjs. For KYC verification, I'll use IPFS to store the document and encrypt the file. The admins can decrypt the file when verifying. This process of encryption, decryption and verification can be handled using Solidity.  There is also an option to create open elections or invite-based. Invite-based elections can be done using EmailJS and SendGrid to send the election link to the email. Since these links can be shared, there will be a check to ensure that only the invited voter is voting. To increase user engagement, we will provide a domain `abc.voter` to get them identified as a voter for using our platform. This domain will also mint an NFT and the voter now has it. There are several other features that I would add such as \"Extend Election Dates\", \"Restrict Past Dates\", \"Logout functionality\", \"Profile Edit\", and \"Improve the UI\".",

          "description": "The CHAOSS community develops metrics, practices, and software for measuring open source software community health and sustainability. Augur and Grimoirelab are two powerful open source community health analytics projects supporting the CHAOSS mission. In particular, each has implementation of select metrics based on an expanding set of implementation-agnostic metric definitions associated with various focus areas.\n\nThe CHAOSS Metrics Model Working group defines metric models, which integrate multiple CHAOSS metrics in a way that makes it easy for end users such as community managers to get a more comprehensive measure of an open source community. Currently, Conversion Rate can be defined as a metric or metric model. It measures the rates at which new contributors to an open source project move through the \"contributor funnel\" toward sustained contribution and/or community maintainership. There is no implementation of the Conversion Rate metric or metric model in CHAOSS software yet.\n\nThis project aims to build a novel implementation of Conversion Rate as a metric model that is based on a minimum number of atomic metrics and has maximum reuse of existing implemented metrics as well as common metric model calculation code supporting all types of conversion rates. A simple config file based UI for entering parameters and filters by the users is all it takes to run the metric model. \n\nNew metrics will be implemented first in Jupyter Notebook as reference code and can later migrate into Grimoirelab backend (for sharing with future new metric models or reports) along with data collection and enrichment extensions. The Metric Model calculation code and methods, and a common visualization interface will be also implemented in Jupyter Notebook, followed by a deployment with OpenSearch Dashboards visualization.",

The data is collected across various sources like open source repos, mailing lists and other communication systems. Augur uses categorised workers to collect specific data.\nCurrently CHAOSS provides metrics by dividing them into working groups. Few of such metrics are frequency of contributions, types of contributions, time frame between opening and closing a pull request, diversity and inclusion, leadership, efficiency and effectiveness of mentorship programs.\nThis project will play an important role in analysing the open source community health. It provides an efficient way to compute and visualise the metrics through an API. Using this API will provide a more accessible way to understand and visualise various metrics.\nDeliverables:\n1. Create an API for visualising the metrics provided by various machine learning workers and improve their performance.\n2. Work on implementing new metrics within the augur machine learning workers and test the performance of newly added metrics with the optimised model to see if the optimised model works for new metrics added.\n3.

It will allow for a Raspberry Pi running NetBSD to take advantage of the dedicated graphics processor, which could be useful for other programs which currently use software rasterization to utilize OpenGL ES. Specifically, the project will be compatible with Mesa as-is, allowing existing programs which depend on Mesa for graphics API support to be able to support the Raspberry Pi's GPU under NetBSD. This will be solved by porting the existing driver to be managed inside a NetBSD loadable kernel module, which can be loaded at runtime when needed. When complete, this will allow for OpenGL ES programs which have been ported to NetBSD from Linux, and already utilize the GPU under Linux to similarly use the GPU under NetBSD, such as programs which can render a triangle, a teapot, and some games.",

This project performs the computations for the MR scanners, although it can be used for any modality. However, these computations were largely limited to the study level - how frequently a scanner idled between studies and how long it took for a scanner to perform a given study. Computing those metrics in a finger granularity, at the series level, is more challenging since the start time and end time of a series is harder to find with just public DICOM headers.\nFurthermore, while this project has a scanner utilization computed in the backend, there is no integrated front-end to present the results elegantly.

          "description": "Tardis is an open-source project that is designed for rapid spectral modelling of supernovae. It is widely used by astrophysicists to model supernovas. When new astrophysicists start using the Tardis, they would use the help of the past projects to understand the simulated spectra. So it is important to continuously update the simulated spectra of past projects as the code of Tardis gets modified. \nCurrently, there are 3 past projects which are stored in the tardis-setups repository. Each time there is a change in the codebase of Tardis, it is hard to manually run the projects and update the spectra. So a CI/CD framework should be created to automate comparing and publishing the results. To achieve this, we intend to use a combination of Github Actions and Azure Pipelines. Azure Pipelines will be used to perform the actual calculations and obtain the graphs since they provide more computing power. On the other hand, GitHub Actions will be used to publish the results.\nThe existing projects have different ways to run the simulations. So the existing projects will be modified so that they can be integrated into the pipeline. Guidelines will also be put in place to allow future contributors to add more projects.",

The two use cases which were used in the description were much interested. I was learning with the react over the past 10 months. So I would like to solve the problem in a good manner like combining the react with PHP or Python.  So, First of all, they asked us to build a menu section that should be globally active around the other pages. This can be done by the react components. Which I had the idea of doing it. In the second use case, they asked to create a menu(s) that changes from page to page like the \"Content Moderator Shortcuts\" menu to the \"moderator\" role. Which we can implement with React router dom. But the main task of this objective is to combine the react with drupal. While we know Drupal still serves as a backend repository, front-end frameworks can talk to the database via API calls. By making the  Make a stand-alone front-end and using drupal to create APIs which interact with the database. Then consume the API through HTTP AJAX or whatever mechanism React Js contains.

Through this, it will not only be easier for the user to be on-boarded but also simple for developers to add tours for the new features they implement.\n\n### Proposed UX\n\nIf the user is new to a feature/page or completely new to the portal, the flow is as follows:\n\n1. The introduction tutorial is triggered automatically and an option to play appears.\n2. The relevant steps are loaded and played through react-tour.\n3. User is notified of the /tutorials page in-case they want to replay the tour.\n\nIf the user wants to play a tour manually, the flow is as follows:\n\n1. User clicks on a relevant tutorial on the tutorials page.\n2. React-Tour is triggered with relevant steps for the tutorial.\n3. The user plays through the tutorial.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nTo do this, I propose a simple system where all the **steps** for each tutorial are stored in JSON format which is readable by the [react-tour](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactour) package. On playing a particular tutorial, our code will read in the relevant steps and pass it to the react-tour component to run.\n\nAdditionally, I would add functionality to trigger this tour through code if needed. This way, new features can be shown to the user without the user needing to click on tutorials manually.\n\nThe JSON can also be lazy-loaded as needed if there are a lot of tours as it might increase the network usage of a user.",

This means that variable assignment, procedure parameters, and function return values will all be clearly connected with a type. Strict is a typescript compiler option that enables a set of tougher type rules that, when enabled, assist lower the possibilities of producing surprising outcomes and make the code more resilient, but Oppia's code base presently fails to pass these stringent requirements. As a result, the code is vulnerable to unexpected actions and failures. To avoid this, modify the strict TypeScript config file such that all newly-added files must be strictly typed, and Introduce strict typing for about 280 twins of files, as well as tests for those files (for a total of 560 files), and ensure that no more unknown type is used, as well as removing all unknown type usage from the newly strictly typed files.

After that, the version history data will be fetched for the \"active state\" each time the state editor loads or gets updated. After fetching the data, the link \"Last edited by XXX at version YYY\" can be shown to the user and on clicking the link, the comparison data would be fetched and a modal would popup showing the difference between versions YYY and YYY + 1. The modal would contain another link and the same logic will be implemented to update the modal data to the \"previously edited version\" each time the user clicks on the link until they reach the version when the state was created.",

Documentation is of two types - 1) Documentation within the code and 2) Documentation about the code. Ruby supports the generation of documentation for a particular codebase using comments written internally in files by tools such as RDoc, and YARD. RBS is a newly developed language for describing the structure of Ruby programs. RBS, similar to Ruby, supports adding comments in the source file. Hence, this feature can be effectively utilized to write encoded inline documentation to later generate well-formatted markup documentation. RBS currently has support for a lot of features.

MNE-Python has all the components necessary for time-frequency source estimate viewing and would be greatly improved by integrating them to allow for exploration of this complex data. A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to look at regions of high power spectral density, while letting the user dynamically adjust the range of frequencies, would be incredibly helpful for allowing this kind of data to be explored and analyzed. The ability to browse slices has already been implemented in `mne.gui.ieeg_locate` and could be abstracted to be used in this case. Time-frequency plotting of spectrograms, with appropriate units and baseline correction already exists in MNE-Python as well.

Sometimes for example they should do in different altitudes the same pattern. Therefore we need an option to add another flightpath on a view. Also it should be possible to toggle the active state, so that it is possible to alter data. On toggling a flightpath the data table gets updated.\n\n\n- the server can use categories to filter existing flight paths. After some defined time a flightpath should be moved to inactive state to have the UI showing only current flightpaths. There should be an option for the creator to reactivate an inactive flightpath and also inactivate one.\n\n\n- invite link to operations Besides that one creator can add others to an operation, we want an option to get invited. by clicking on an invite link.

The purpose of this project will be to extend the measures of functional connectivity using a state-space modeling approach utilizing the observed variables (sensor measurements) to estimate functional connectivity across latent variables (neurological regions of interest). The output of this method will provide time-varying autoregressive (AR) coefficients, indicative of the connection strength between any two latent variables. The model’s output will be used to draw a directed graph as a visualization tool to understand information flow across latent variables. Statistical methods will be implemented in order to determine statistical differences between different network configurations.",

Taking into account all the possible pre-processing strategies, there exists an extremely large number of options and non-experienced users become overwhelmed. A lot of research has been done for providing help and an overview of the different steps of data analysis.

It enables users to integrate Fortran code into Python easily and quickly. F2PY has been in maintenance mode since 2009, ever since it became feature-complete for Fortran 77. Beginners browsing its codebase in the current state might find it challenging to read, understand and contribute. The frontend of F2PY is a handwritten command line parser that predates the intrinsic ‘argparse’ module by several years.\n\nThis project will include modernising the CLI with the “argparse” python library, simplifying the frontend codebase and making it more developer-friendly to contribute to.\n\nSince “np.distutils” is set for deprecation, I propose adding an option to build the F2PY’s generated CPython extension modules with Meson. Meson will significantly speed up building standalone extension modules through the F2PY CLI. There is no change proposed to the process of generating C and Fortran wrappers from Fortran source files. Generation of the source code for integration in Python projects will be carried out in the same way. Currently, “np.distutils” is used by F2PY to build generated extension modules. Adding a Meson backend will provide faster builds and long-term backend support for F2PY.\n\nAdditionally, I plan to re-implement the class-based test-suite of F2PY in a modern pytest manner and add a developer’s guide to F2PY.",

There are numerous methods, models, and algorithms for data cleaning processes that might be categorized under imputation, outlier detections, formatting, and visualizations among others. The process of evaluating these methods for a given dataset is challenging considering the volume of the dataset and the time/space complexities of the methods. Automation of the performance evaluation process can lead to a significant reduction in human efforts and time consumption with an unbiased comparison environment. \n\nThe imputeTestbench package provides a benchmarking tool for automated performance evaluation and comparison of various imputation methods for time-series datasets. In its present form, the package is capable of handling time-series and temporal datasets. Imputation plays a crucial role in the fields of genetics and genomics. The aforementioned package can be very helpful if it can be modified to handle genetic or genomics datasets. It has huge potential in handling genetic/ genomics datasets and introducing parallel-processing and high-performance computing concepts.\n\nConsidering these as a motivation, the goal of the project is to develop a new R package, modifying the imputeTestbench package for Genomics applications with better computational capabilities and will be named 'imputeTestbenchG'.",

The two-stage pipeline will begin with feature filtering using pre-trained classifiers and heuristic-based approaches. This stage will produce noisy title sequence segmented data containing audio, video, and possibly text. These extracted multimedia snippets will then be passed to the second pipeline stage. In the second stage, the extracted features from the multimedia snippets will be clustered using RNN-DBSCAN. Title sequence detection is possibly the most efficient path to high precision segmentation for the first and second tiers of the Rosenthal collection (which have fairly structured recordings). This detection algorithm may not bode well for the more unstructured V8+ and V4 VCR tapes in the Rosenthal collection.

Massive textual corpora – such as those created from social media data – and the tools and theories of corpus linguistics enable researchers to track patterns of linguistic entrenchment. Meanwhile, the theory of frame semantics in cognitive linguistics offers a framework for understanding how particular linguistic units help language users conceptualize broader experiential or abstract scenes. By integrating frame semantic parsing into the analysis of divergent entrenchment of linguistic units between social clusters within a social media discourse, we can potentially derive observations about divergent conceptualization of a given topic.",

The results from the previous algorithm are pretty similar to Paul's manually annotated spreadsheet shared by Tim. In my proposed approach, major problems with the algorithm can be solved, So I have decided to continue the show segmentation project. Some of the anchors are misinterpreted, leading us to the wrong show name. There are 2 ways to solve it by improving the boundary detection, thus improving the clustering algorithm, and using a cleaned MS-Celeb dataset. Combining both approaches will definitely enhance our boundary segmentation by up to 90%, resulting in final high accuracy in predicting show names and networks. We’ll try to finalize the segmentation project by this summer, and this should be the end of the past 5 years of quality research.",

Art historians such as Emile Male have spent a significant amount of time describing this art.

Hence the goal of this project is to curate a dataset for tagging this arena of art.

A single stream of data can contain multiple sound effects, so the model should be able to label them from a group of known sound effects like a Multi-label classification problem. The first step would be to develop a baseline model using existing pre-trained deep learning models and add to the Red Hen’s pipeline. Then the performance can be improved using transfer learning and fine tuning the existing model to achieve better accuracy. In this process, the models can be trained on sound effects from noisy or human labeled data sets after they are pre-processed to avoid acoustic domain mismatch problems.",

Expressing different concepts such as time, place, and emotion comes with speech and some movements called body gestures. In this study, we propose a multi-modal method that captures different patterns of body gestures aligned with an articulated time expression such as \"from beginning to end\". Our proposed architecture lies on two neural networks, the Compact Transformer and the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Compact Transformer which is the current State-of-the-art structure for temporally distributed images also performs well over low-resourced data. LSTM performs well over temporal data with long-term dependencies. The hypothesis of this project is the existence of a relation between the body gestures and the time expressions we speak and using neural networks we try to accept or reject this hypothesis.",

          "description": "Shot Boundary Detection of films is an important task that is mostly performed manually. There are some available tools and existing research which tend to automate the process. However, in the case of old archival films, available tools fail to detect most of the shot boundaries. State-of-the-art research performs quite well in detecting these boundaries, but these methods come with high time complexity and are not feasible to use in real life. In this work, an efficient and accurate shot boundary detection is proposed which should work well with archival films. The proposed tool will be built upon the existing work 'FilmEditDetection', which is developed during the last summer of code. The proposed tool should be able to detect the shot boundaries, which the previous tool fails to detect, without compromising the time complexity of the entire tool. This is achieved by using a machine learning-based framework on top of the cut detection module(Siamese Network). Few new features are also to be added to the tool - Average Shot Length, Comparison of individual shot lengths, etc. The current version of the tool is based on CLI. A graphical user interface can be developed based on the tool for simplicity of use.",

Particularly, this includes the data synchronization with the end-users.\n\nCurrently, Airavata is extending an open-source project called “open-inventory” with additional features. Airavata is using three individual and unrelated databases to save the Literature data, Experimental data, and Computational data. Having these in usage, the chemical compounds are represented with ambiguous keys and missing data.\n\nTherefore, the scientific representation of the compounds with a specific structure; scientific data model (SDM), and related ontology (SDMO) is much better to analyze the behavior of a compound. In particular, a common data model should be used to synchronize the data efficiently.",

It focuses on how to reuse existing databases and their respective upper layer, rather than creating a new database. The goal is to minimize or eliminate the challenges caused by underlying database fragmentation.\n\nShardingSphere parser engine is the core of ShardingSphere, It helps users parse a SQL to get the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and visit this tree to get SQLStatement (Java Object). At present, this parser engine can handle SQLs for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, openGauss and Oracle. However, there are still many statements that are not supported yet.\n\nTherefore this project proposes to Solve unsupported Postgres sql about alter statements for ShardingSphere parser and also proofread and optimize the grammar wherever needed.\n\nThe following will be the design/description of work, proofread through DDLStatement.g4 to analyze existing grammars and optimize them (essential), write grammar for unsupported alter statements referring to the official PostgreSQL documentation (essential), implement visit methods for the statements (essential), add new corresponding SQL cases in SQL Cases and expected parsed results in Expected Statement XML (essential), Run SQLParserParameterizedTest and UnsupportedSQLParserParameterizedTest to make sure there are no exceptions (essential).\n\nSuccessful Implementation of the project will add proper support for PostgreSQL Alter Statements ensuring there are no exceptions for the following statements,  ALTER OPERATOR, ALTER POLICY, ALTER PUBLICATION, ALTER ROUTINE, ALTER RULE, ALTER SCHEMA, ALTER SEQUENCE, ALTER SERVER, ALTER STATISTICS, ALTER SUBSCRIPTION, ALTER TABLE, ALTER TEXT SEARCH,ALTER TRIGGER, ALTER TYPE, ALTER VIEW.\n\nThis project will significantly improve the ShardingSphere parser engine.",

To extract the relevant features in log events, the feature extraction technique divides the log data set into finite blocks using a window. A representative approach of supervised learning is used to execute the final anomaly detection process (SVM).

This GSoC project aims to perform much needed research into using face tracking as a viable means to improve the accessibility of 3D virtual spaces, much like those found in the metaverse. The result benefits all users, whether or not they have specific needs for accessibility: improved interaction vectors and empathy channels liberate all users.

Shmdata is server-less, but requires applications to link data streams using socket path (e.g. \"/tmp/my-shmdata-stream\"). Shmdata is very fast and allows processes to access data streams without the need for extra copies.\n\nHowever, permissions are not supported, and any stream shared on the system with Shmdata is accessible system-wide. The project will enable the possibility for a Shmdata user to configure streams permission using shared memory right setting at the API level.\n\nWhen sharing data between processes via shared memory, not all components of the data need to be visible to everyone. Different groups might need to access different data, furthermore, some data might only be needed to be visible to the owner of the files. In such cases, the permissions that would have to be implemented are combinations of 'read', 'write' and 'execute' permissions that would be given to the owner, group or common user(i.e. everyone else).\n\nPermissions would be 'none', 'execute only', 'write only', 'write and execute', 'read only', 'read and execute', 'read and write', 'read, write and execute' with corresponding values of 0-7 respectively.\n\nDELIVERABLES\n\n* Providing an option for users to restrict or openly share data streams via these file/ directory access modes: read, write and execute/traverse.\n\n* Changing data access permissions.\n\n* Documentation for the improvements made.\n\n* Incorporation of ACL to assist with Unix file permissions.

Users need to define their own policy when implementing KubeArmor. Most users might find it challenging to define the most appropriate and effective security policy based on their use case. Currently there are limited ways for users to actually get observability data that can be used to assist them and provide better reasoning when creating an optimal security policy. The solution to this problem is by providing visibility telemetry events to show pod or container observability data. Observability data can consist of processes executions, file system accesses, and network accesses. This information is expected to assist users to create an optimal security policy. This solution is implemented by developing and deploying a Kubernetes service that will connect to the KubeArmor relay and get the events from the daemonsets. These events will then be aggregated and stored in the database for future use. Users can get the data by using the KubeArmor CLI program which will be extended to accommodate this solution.",

          "description": "A key challenge surrounding modern bioinformatics is to manage and store the growing amount of biological data with both space efficiency and scalability. Traditionally, biological data are often stored as human-readable flat files or as entries in a conventional relational database. However, a drawback of such approaches is that the space required to maintain these data is becoming increasingly unmanageable, significantly reducing the scalability. Additionally, along with the size of the database, the time to query the database also increases. As stated in the problem statement, on Ensembl, homology data are currently stored as tuples in a relational database, resulting in the whole database being large and hard to scale. A natural way to compactly store the data is to exploit the intrinsic hierarchical structure of homology relationships. We propose multiple hierarchical data structures and formatting methods to improve the space efficiency of homology databases as well as important metrics to consider when designing such data structures and formats. We propose these potential approaches with the application in actual gene homology databases in mind. As part of the project, we will implement the representations using Python and/or C++ and evaluate them using proposed metrics.",

Also, due to the poor entity normalization approach, many extracted entities are being ignored in the final output stage of the pipeline. \n\nThis project proposal aims to increase the entity detection capabilities of this “Named Entity Recognition” (NER) system by firstly integrating additional RegEx/string matching rules in the current pipeline.

          "description": "Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of events like social migrations, floods, droughts and forest fires, threatening the livelihoods of humans around the world. Because of this, it is urgent to create models that try to predict the responses of ecosystems and also report the degree of uncertainty around their predictions in order to improve policies that can counteract the effects of climate change. Quantifying precisely the degree of uncertainty of models predictions and acknowledging the existing data gaps still remains challenging given the immense variety of data sources that exist and the lack of open source tools that quantify the models' uncertainty. The PEcAn (Predictive Ecosystem global Analyzer) project is an open-source tool that aims to solve this problem by synthesizing multiple data sources for the improvement of model-data feedback. With this tool it is possible to use models for forecasting how an ecosystem might respond to climate change and also is possible to quantify the uncertainty around its predictions. However, currently PEcAn uses a method that do not explore the whole parameter space, giving an incomplete quantification of the uncertainty around important variables in models. Thus, it is necessary to develop new functionalities in PEcAn in order to improve the assessment of ecosystem models' uncertainties. The Sobol Variance Partitioning (SVP) is a method for accessing the degree of uncertainty in models that explore all the parameter space, improving the quantification of model uncertainties. In this project, we will focus on developing a new function within PEcAn that estimates the uncertainty components of a model taking into account higher-order parameter interactions using the SVP method.",
