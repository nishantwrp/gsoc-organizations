Connecting these two systems would enhance forecast precision by 20% and enable users to compare forecasted data with real-time generation figures. The problem statement thus asks to seamlessly integrate live Enphase Inverter data into the Open Source Quartz Solar Forecast. I will use Python to develop a dedicated module and add it to the Open Source Quartz Solar Forecast library. This integration will involve retrieving live data from Enphase Inverters via the Enphase API and incorporating it into the forecasting algorithm. Upon completion, users will be able to leverage live data from Enphase Inverters within the Open Source Quartz Solar Forecast. I will thoroughly test this integration using authentic Enphase API credentials to ensure reliability. I will additionally deliver comprehensive example code and documentation, improving user experience and facilitating seamless execution of the forecast with genuine credentials. I will extend the project’s reach by compiling a curated list of analogous Solar Inverter companies to Enphase and write dedicated code to facilitate live data retrieval from these identified Solar Inverter systems, which will enable users to fetch live data from various solar inverter platforms and utilize it for forecasting purposes, similar to the capabilities provided for Enphase Inverters. This will empower users with diverse solar setups to benefit from accurate and insightful forecasting capabilities tailored to their specific systems.",

Next, the project will tune and benchmark the LLM to generate high-quality musical compositions in ABC format. Once tuned, the LLM will be deployed to a server environment, and API endpoints will be set up to enable interaction with MusicBlocks. Users will initiate compositions in MusicBlocks, which will be sent to the LLM for enhancement. The LLM will generate multiple compositions based on the user's input, which will be converted back to MusicBlocks format for further enhancement. Throughout the project, integration testing and flow testing will ensure seamless interaction between MusicBlocks and the LLM API. Comprehensive documentation will provide insights into the implementation process, results of benchmarking and testing, and recommendations for future improvements. This integration of AI-generated compositions into MusicBlocks aims to inspire creativity, deepen musical understanding, and enhance the learning experience for users",

          "description": "The Music Blocks v4 project is a complete overhaul of the original Music Blocks project, which was derived from the Turtle Blocks project. The existing implementation, which started in 2015 using native Vanilla JavaScript, lacks modern front-end tooling and ecosystem standards, leading to difficulties in maintenance and subpar performance. The v4 project uses improved application architecture, modern tools (such as Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, Jest, Cypress, etc.), better languages (TypeScript and Sass), and libraries (React for UI rendering). This will significantly enhance the overall developer and user experience, maintainability, and performance. The proposal focuses on implementing one of the main features of Music Blocks, the \"Project Builder\", which is currently missing in the new version (v4). The Project Builder is a graphical blocks manager module used to create Music Blocks programs, including interactive blocks like Start, Rhythm, Note, Pitch, Instrument, and many more. These blocks can be dragged, dropped, and clicked to perform actions or open context menus. By implementing the Project Builder feature end-to-end, users will be able to create different musical patterns seamlessly. This will bring the v4 project on par with the capabilities of the old version (v1) and provide a more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly application for users to create music through an interactive web application.",

In order to do this I will look out for the results from scalene and memray profilers. I will use faster algorithms, C/C++ libraries or functions and tools like mpi4py, polar etc to improve the codebase in terms of space and time complexity when running on both multi and single core.",

          "description": "Understanding photon-ion interactions within ejecta is crucial for interpreting astronomical spectra. While the TARDIS SDEC plot visualizes which ions photon packets interact with, it lacks information on where these interactions occur within the ejecta. This information can be extremely useful to astronomers who want to understand which regions of the ejecta are responsible for important features in the output spectrum. \nThe project addresses this issue by developing a visualization tool that plots the number of photon packet interactions as a function of velocity for each element present in the ejecta. It involves obtaining interaction data post-simulation, creating an interactive widget comprising spectrum selection, ion frequency display, and velocity histogram, and it is stored in a dedicated class.\nThe project will deliver a fully functional interactive widget designed to visualize photon-ion interactions by velocity, significantly enhancing astronomers' ability to interpret astronomical spectra. This widget will provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the regions within ejecta responsible for specific spectral features. Alongside the widget, the project will also produce a suite of thorough test cases ensuring the accuracy and functionality of the tool. Additionally, comprehensive documentation will be provided, offering detailed guidance on implementing and utilizing the visualization tool effectively. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for users seeking to integrate the tool into their research workflows.",

Currently, as a visualization tool, we have the \"Spectral element DEComposition (SDEC) Plot,\" which generates the output spectrum of the supernovae. However, there is a lot of other information a researcher might need, and this project aims to solve one, i.e., getting the interaction information. TARDIS already has a Tracker functionality which tracks all the interactions in the ejecta, which requires some optimizations and refactoring. I will also be introducing another Tracking Functionality, which will precisely track the last interaction. The Current Tracking functionality has no tests to check if the data generated by it is correct. So, I will also be writing tests. I will also be documenting the trackers.",

This manual adjustment process consumes significant resources and bandwidth, posing challenges for effective access and use of the software by individuals with visual impairments.\n\nThe idea is to address this issue by introducing a new settings feature in MuseScore. This feature will provide a list of standard accessibility profiles, such as normal, large, etc., each one customised to specific needs of users with low vision.

On the other hand, deterministic simulation with Madsim offers complete control over the execution environment, but it often lacks the rich fault models needed for comprehensive chaos testing.

In order to achieve that, this proposal intends to create an implementation for all databases supported that developers can use in order to update partial values of JSONField.\n\nThis project aims to accomplish the problem by dividing it into two big parts: first, implement JSONSet and JSONRemove functions to allow partial updates to JSONField. Second, add support for key transforms in update() for JSONField to make it easier to use for developers.\n\nThe project will be executed on creating JSONSet for SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle first, then, create JSONRemove on same databases.

It would reduce the time invested in making the analysis work and even who are novice to command line tools to gain the benefits of Stingray. \nThe proposed solution involves creating a web-based dashboard that streamlines the process of data visualization and analysis. The dashboard will have predefined (parameter can be edited by users) functions that users can choose to analyse the data and get the required plots in the dashboard itself. \nThe aim is also to educate novice users/ UG-PG students to get to know about how the analysis is being done.

          "description": "In an era where astronomical discovery is more vibrant than ever, the significant role of data cannot be overstated. However, the diversity and complexity of these datasets often pose substantial challenges, hampering their full potential for insights. This project, under the Open Astronomy initiative and in partnership with NASA's Science Platform Initiative, proposes a novel approach to transcend these barriers using artificial intelligence (AI). The project aims to tackle the inherent challenges presented by the vast and diverse nature of astronomical datasets, including variations in temporal spans, wavelength coverages, resolutions, and depths, thereby facilitating a more cohesive and comprehensive approach to astronomical research.\n\nThe core objectives include the design and optimization of a deep learning architecture adept at processing and improving astronomical data, and conducting comprehensive testing on large samples of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed model. Deliverables encompass a fully developed deep learning architecture, complete with documentation and guidelines for implementation and use in astronomical data analysis, and a detailed report outlining testing methodologies, results, and a comparative analysis of data quality before and after the application of the deep learning model.\n\nThis project not only represents a significant technical achievement but also fosters collaboration within the astronomical community, building bridges between data science and astronomy. My enthusiasm for data science, combined with a commitment to open-source collaboration, aligns perfectly with the values of OpenAstronomy and the NASA Science Platform Initiative, presenting a unique opportunity to deploy AI and data analysis skills in a manner that enriches astronomical research and advances our understanding of the universe.",

Currently, sunpy-soar offers only basic metadata, such as SOOP name, time, and level.

These tables contain valuable metadata like filenames, filesize, sensors, and instrument-specific data. By implementing these tables, users will be able to access a broader range of metadata in sunpy-soar.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to enable querying multiple tables simultaneously to retrieve more comprehensive metadata. This involves updating the sunpy-soar/client module to support constructing queries with metadata from different tables. We will also refine the sunpy-soar/attrs module to handle new metadata attributes efficiently.\n\nOverall, the deliverables encompass the entire process of updating and enhancing metadata support in sunpy-soar, from implementation to documentation, ensuring that users can effectively utilize the improved functionality for solar data exploration.",

The coarse resolution of PEcAn's current outputs limits their applicability for localized analyses of carbon dynamics. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Neural Networks (STRNNs), this project will enhance the accuracy and granularity of PEcAn's model outputs, enabling more detailed analyses to support ecosystem management and climate change mitigation efforts.\n\nThe project will involve developing a robust data preparation pipeline to handle diverse covariate datasets, including climate variables, land cover, soil properties, and disturbance history. Time-varying covariates and disturbance events will be integrated to capture their influence on carbon flux dynamics. Tailored CNN and STRNN architectures will be designed and implemented to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Comprehensive model training, evaluation, and optimization strategies will be employed to ensure accurate downscaling performance.\n\nThe developed models and workflows will be seamlessly integrated into the existing PEcAn framework, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility for researchers and practitioners. User-friendly interfaces, command-line tools, and comprehensive documentation will facilitate the adoption and usage of the downscaling capabilities.\n\nThe key deliverables include a scalable data preparation pipeline, optimized CNN and STRNN architectures for downscaling, model training and evaluation pipelines, evaluation metrics , and the integration of the developed solution into the PEcAn framework with user-friendly interfaces and documentation.",

By introducing this functionality, Krita users looking to utilize the pixel art functionalities alongside with Krita’s features can have an easier time controlling the precision and aesthetics of their pixel art creations.",

However, to cater to the evolving demands of scientific research, it is imperative to extend LabPlot's visualization toolkit into 3D plotting.\nThe rationale behind this expansion lies in the intrinsic limitations of 2D visualization when dealing with complex, multidimensional datasets. While 2D plots provide valuable insights into relationships between two variables, they often need to capture the intricate interplay among multiple dimensions in scientific data. By introducing comprehensive support for 3D plotting, LabPlot aims to overcome these limitations and empower researchers with a more immersive and insightful visualization experience.",

This often breaks form functionality for the users. Also at present, many essential objects and functionalities outlined in the PDF Javascript API Reference specification are either only partially implemented or completely absent. This leads to a lot of bug reports regarding broken form support for Okular. This project aims to resolve this, by improving the Javascript support for PDF forms.

Support for parsing command line arguments in Rust programs running within the .NET runtime. \n\n2. Implementation of atomic intrinsics needed for `std` argument parsing to function properly. They should be implemented using cross-platform .NET APIs, but using architecture-specific functions may be needed to properly handle certain atomics.\n\n3. Support for dynamic trait objects - creating them, dropping them, calling their member functions.\n\n4. Support for catching panics, implemented using the .NET exception-handling primitives.\n\n5. Support for multithreading: launching threads, and getting information about them.\n\n6. Extended .NET interop, automatic creation of safe GC handles for managed objects. This feature is necessary for safely handling .NET threads, but will be exposed in the `mycorrhiza` interop layer, provided by the codegen. \n\n7. Fixes to string formatting. This feature is necessary for reporting test results. At the end of this proposal, simple formatting, such as `format!(\"my string is:{string}\")` should run within the .NET runtime.\n\nThe end goal of this proposal is running a simple cargo test within the .NET runtime.

To support this, I will develop wrappers for exporting compiled difflogic models for use in the languages supported on Bela (C++, Pure Data, SuperCollider, Csound).\n\nI will then build out integrations and applications of difflogic for the rapid development of useful audio models, exploring the possibilities for combining difflogic networks with DDSP (differentiable digital signal processing) and cheap/lightweight techniques and toolkits, \"porting\" well-known ML architectures to difflogic networks, and training difflogic networks to approximate the behavior of existing neural networks (knowledge distillation). I will develop example applications involving sound analysis, classification, and synthesis, and experiment with interactive machine learning.\n\nFinally, I will apply these techniques to a creative application inspired by work on bytebeat and sound matching: generating networks of logic gates to approximate sounds and exploring the space of such sound-generating networks. I will train difflogic gates to reproduce particular sounds, treating the entire network as a bytebeat-style audio-generating function of time.\nLastly, I will build an interactive application to explore the space of sound-generating networks (e.g. by mutating or morphing networks) and visualize the execution of logic gate networks.",

          "description": "This project aims to introduce Zephyr RTOS support on BeagleBone AI 64 by integrating essential drivers and enabling advanced inter-processor communication (IPC) between Zephyr and Linux cores. Part of the BeagleBone AI 64 platform, the TDA4VM System-on-Chip (SoC) has an intricate architecture that includes two Arm Cortex-A72 cores and six Arm Cortex-R5F cores of which two Arm Cortex-R5F cores are located on a different MCU island. Such configurations epitomize asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP), facilitating the concurrent operation of a full-fledged operating system (OS) alongside a real-time operating system (RTOS).\n\nThe suggested approach uses remoteproc from the Linux-powered A72 core to load the Zephyr RTOS onto the BeagleBone AI 64. Defining Kconfig-based existing board support and using the current Hardware Model Version2(HWMv2) instead of the previous OOT model while Adding major drivers to allow seamless interaction such as I2C, SPI, and mailbox. \n\nThe deliverables for this project are:\n1. Basic Zephyr support integrated with BeagleBone AI 64.\n2. IPC examples demonstrating communication between Zephyr and Linux cores.\n3. Additional drivers for mailbox and TI-SCI implemented and integrated.",

Currently, certain features such as aio_fsync() and aio_return() lack support or do not adhere fully to POSIX standards. Additionally, lio_listio(), aio_suspend(), and aio_init() are entirely missing, although the latter is part of an extension provided by the GNU C library.\n\nThe project will progress incrementally. Initially, AIO processing will be refactored to improve readability and maintainability by creating dedicated helper methods for each request type. Subsequently, existing method deficiencies will be addressed. The message structure between aio_ functions and the server will be modified to accommodate various messages, including those for all aio_ operations and user-provided counts for lio_listio. The server thread will be modified to manage a list of AIO operations instead of being restricted to a single operation.\n\nNext, the missing methods will be implemented, and thorough test coverage will be ensured to validate their functionalities. Finally, documentation will be updated as needed. The implementation of aio_init() is considered optional and may be addressed if primary objectives are completed early.",

This is a crucial part of any RAG applications and helps us in building the right prompt context for LLMs. \n\nWe will implement the following deliverables to achieve this:\n\n1. Build a Beam pipeline that takes in a batch text corpus from a public dataset as parameter to pipeline and uses MLTransform to generate and save Embeddings in batch mode to a vector database.\n- Initial scope: Wikipedia dataset with JinaAI Embeddings read from object storage and written to RedisIO to publish to known vector DB.\n\n2. Build a Beam pipeline that takes in stream of text questions from clients and enriches it with related texts from the vector DB.\n- Initial scope: KafkaIO based reading of queries which is populated by producers independently and published in a different topic for results.\n\n3. New enrichment handlers for vector database queries over Redis based Vector DB\n\nStretch goals:\n\n1. Implement enrichment handlers for OpenSearch (AWS supported)[4]\n2. Implement enrichment handlers for Vertex AI Vector Search (GCP Supported)[5]\n\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate semantic search building capabilities trivially using Beam and hence evaluation of search results is not tied to a broad benchmark (such as MTEB) for this project's scope.",

The project aims to design and implement a unified memory management framework to address this limitation. This framework will include features such as lifecycle management of memory objects, memory capacity restrictions, and an allocator interface for efficient memory allocation and release. By implementing this framework, the project is expected to improve the stability and performance of the hugegraph-server, ultimately enhancing its usability and reliability for users.",

          "description": "For the last 200 years research into human cognition and decision-making has revolved around rational choice theory, which assumes that actors are utility maximizers capable of searching and finding rational and optimal decisions. However human behavioral data doesn’t support the assumptions that we have infinite time nor infinite cognitive energy to search the full space of candidate choices to produce optimal decisions. Take for example a hiker, who has an infinite number of paths to choose from. It's irrational to assume that the hiker is capable of fully evaluating each of the infinite paths available to them to then choose the most rational/ optimal path. And yet that is the operating assumption for most modern cognitive models. To remedy this problem, I propose three axiomatic principles of energy-efficient decision making, along with an optimal-control based model and Deep Q learning model that capture those principles. I hope that a formalization of my theory of energy-efficient decision making along with the open-source python library we develop can be used by researchers in private and academic settings to develop more accurate computational models of human decision making, that can be used to model agent behavior in a number of fields ranging from market behavior to crowd dynamics, along with improving LLM infrastructures.",

Analyse the benefits of the change.\n\nGoal 3: Employ techniques like Tandem DNN-HMMs, RNN-Transducers and WSFTs and analyse the benefits, if any\n\nAmbitious Goal 4: Employ state-of-the-art techniques to improve speaker diarization.

          "description": "Neural networks are descendants of McCulloch & Pitts' threshold-based mathematical model of a binary neuron, but there is ample evidence that unicellular organisms are capable of relatively complex maze navigation and other cognitive tasks, indicating information-processing capabilities in cellular subsystems. The task is to develop a computational model of elementary processing of analog information using Schrödinger's wave equation and Pilot Wave theory, leveraging the fact that a quantum wave function has multiple valid solutions and only one of them manifests. In Bohm & Hiley's elaboration of Pilot Wave theory, the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Equation can be decomposed into a classical component and a quantum component, the quantum potential. Most of the energy is in the classical component, but a small part of it is in the quantum potential. As the energy in the quantum potential is informed by and responds to the shape of the quantum wave, the process creates new information, expressed in the trajectory of the particle. The trajectory will help us take decisions. We propose two techniques, Statistical approach and Instantaneous approach. Both of the approaches use Pilot Wave theory since it is causal. For Statistical approach we will model the double slit experiment with Bohmian mechanics. The slits shape will depend on the input. We will pass many particles through the slit and take decision based on the interference pattern produced and the trajectory of the particles. In the second approach we will model the FMO complex in Green Sulphur Bacteria. Our model of the FMO complex will be used for Binary classification. There will be multiple slits in this and we will use AI to find the dimensions and location of the slits. Based on the trajectory we will take decision.",

          "description": "The current FreeBSD system call creation script was implemented to streamline the introduction of system calls into the FreeBSD kernel. It’s a monolithic script, converted from awk to Lua, and has kept much of the procedural-oriented awk code. It does not take full advantage of modern features of Lua (object-oriented design) and is difficult to extend. The goal is to strip the current script into an easily extendable interface. It will utilize classes to give extensible methods to objects, mainly utilizing the facade and command design patterns, to give a more \"bite-sized\" interface to the previously procedural code. This will allow easier maintenance of the Lua tables and procedures, and a better platform to add more. Lua modules will provide better namespacing of globals, dynamic generation of output files,  and more modules with different tasks may be easily added. After refactoring, the previous functionality of the original script can be achieved simply by calling the necessary modules. The benefit to FreeBSD is further streamlining in the creation of system calls, a more maintainable interface, and a strong foundation to build upon in the development of future system call creation tools. It will further demystify the process of system call creation and allow others to more easily contribute. Deliverables are (1) system call creation will work as before; (2) the monolithic script will be refactored into core, modules, and classes; (3) a system call creation library that is easily extensible; and (4) well-documented with conventions used.",

However, its current implementation faces challenges in concurrency and performance due to reliance on lock-based mechanisms. This project aims to enhance the netgraph system by introducing a lockless data passage model. By replacing traditional locking mechanisms with lockless data structures and epoch-based reclamation, the project seeks to improve the efficiency and reliability of data passage within netgraph, ensuring seamless and high-performance network operations.\n\nKey Deliverables:\n\nA modified netgraph system supporting lockless operations, minimizing overhead, and ensuring safe data passage.\nComprehensive documentation covering the implemented changes, including API modifications and usage guides.\nA robust test suite for validating the functionality and performance of the lockless model in various scenarios, including stateless and stateful node interactions.\nPerformance benchmarks demonstrating the improvements in data passage efficiency and system throughput compared to the existing lock-based model.\nCompatibility assurance, ensuring that the lockless model seamlessly integrates with existing netgraph nodes and functionalities without disrupting current operations.\nThis initiative not only aims to bolster the FreeBSD netgraph system's capabilities but also to contribute a significant enhancement to the broader open-source and networking communities. By fostering a more efficient, reliable, and performant network subsystem, the project stands to benefit a wide range of FreeBSD users and developers, furthering the adoption and evolution of open-source networking solutions.",

Typical examples include: toggling of DTrace probes, boot-\ntime optimizations based on hardware capabilities and inclusion of additional\nsecurity checks.

When this is done\nin a ”hot” (i.e. frequently executed) code path, the overhead of the conditional\nexecution can become significant. Moreover, in situations in which the state of\nthe inspected flags changes rarely, most of the performed checks are redundant.\nThe primary goal of this project is to design and implement a low overhead mechanism\nfor conditional execution in contexts in which the branching condition does not\nchange often.

          "description": "The project focuses on the enhancement and refinement of a feature-rich and secure Mobile Wallet application tailored for Government to Person (G2P) payments, demonstrating a potent tool for fintechs and financial institutions. Originating as a Google Summer of Code initiative from 2017-2023, the project delivered the initial mobile wallet framework, evolving into a sophisticated reference application with two primary apps: PixieCollect and MifosPay, later consolidating focus on MifosPay. The developmental trajectory of the project saw significant milestones: integration with Mojaloop transaction flows, user experience enhancements, support for Kotlin, and implementation of standing instructions and merchant transactions.\n\nFurther advancements include integration with Fineract CN, multi-theme support, migration to Kotlin, and a transition towards a multiplatform approach using Kotlin multi-platform. The project aims, in 2024, to finalize G2P functionalities, ensuring production-readiness, improving security, and adopting modern development practices such as Jetpack Compose and leveraging Mifos' Android SDK. It underscores a commitment to evolving into a generic wallet management system through the Mifos X framework, incorporating cutting-edge features like the latest Payment Hub EE version, a new notifications framework, and a redesigned architecture to align with the Open Wallet Foundation's principles. This ambitious endeavor promises to redefine the landscape of mobile wallets, emphasizing security, extensibility, and a seamless user experience for G2P payments and beyond.",

          "description": "I propose to augment the current project by implementing pending pipeline features which will drastically improve the security and capability of the base application.\n\nSpecifically I propose implementing secure RSA encryption to the messaging service, implement secure file sharing with audio and video support and enable user discovery on a WiFi network using UIDs\n\nRSA encryption\nI propose using the rsa_encrypt library in dart to secure the chat service being created between two clients on the same peer network. When two clients are connected on the same peer network, a connection is created using FPTP protocol. This project proposes to use rsa_encrypt to create a security layer over the FPTP layer. Hence the chat service is secure from other possible listeners on the peer network.\n\nSecure file sharing\nI propose to extend the messaging service with file sharing capabilities. We transcribe the file stored in the client’s local storage into raw metadata and securely stream the bytes to the connected client using the RSA encryption layer. The client checks for the file type using MIMETypes and decodes the bytes into the intended file. This implementation is expected to use the dart:convert library for encoding and decoding. The challenge which I aim to surpass is encoding the raw bytes through the RSA layer to ensure that unauthorized listeners cannot access the raw bytes.\n\nFile Viewing\nI propose to implement in app file previews for supported file types using open-file-x and also enable in app viewing for image and video file types.\n\nUser Discovery on a Local Network\nThe challenge here would be for the application to persist UIDs which can be advertised over the WiFi network. Flutter does not have the capability to access users connected to a WiFi network unless the application is the router. Hence I propose to use mDNS to allow the devices to broadcast their presence on the same network without needing a central server.",

          "description": "Traditionally, technology and dance have moved in separate circles, rarely crossing paths. However, the landscape is changing with the rise of AI in the creative world. One exciting development is the use of AI to create dance choreography. This innovation comes from training AI models on videos captured from a dancer's performance, allowing the machine to learn and generate new dance moves, a process well illustrated in the paper Beyond Imitation: Generative and Variational Choreography via Machine Learning.\r\n\r\nBuilding on this very interesting work, our project aims to take things a step further by focusing on duets. We're interested in exploring how AI can choreograph dances that involve complex interactions between the dancers, reflecting a more dynamic and authentic expression of human connection and creativity.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to expand the aforementioned existing work in AI-generated choreography by introducing modern machine learning techniques to create dance sequences for duo performances. Initially using a generative model with LSTM units to learn from motion-captured dance movements, this project proposes a new approach by incorporating self-attention mechanisms and Graph Neural Networks. These technologies are expected to allow a deeper understanding of the relationships within and between dancers' movements over time.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the project will explore the integration of self-attention mechanisms to replace traditional LSTM sequences, enabling the model to more effectively emphasize significant connections across frames of dance movements. Additionally, it seeks to benefit from capturing the spatial relationships between dancers' joints by using GNNs for pre and post-processing.\r\n\r\nThe deliverables of the project  basically consist of the developed dataset and its visualizations, the implemented agents with their respective weights, and a report together with a repository containing the full documentation and code for each step.",

Our objective is to develop a high-accuracy, transformer-based model that can adeptly navigate the complexities of early Spanish texts, providing a reliable tool for digitizing and preserving valuable historical documents.\n\nTo achieve this, we plan to leverage the TrOCR model, renowned for its proficiency with both printed and handwritten texts, thanks to its innovative hybrid architecture that combines Vision Transformers (ViT) with Transformer models. The project will begin with a thorough preprocessing of the documents, converting them from PDFs to high-resolution images suitable for text recognition. Automated segmentation into line segments using PyTesseract will follow, transforming our dataset into a line-wise format ideal for focused model training.\n\nThe deliverables include:\n1. A robust, transformer-based model fine-tuned for recognizing text in seventeenth-century Spanish documents.\n2. A comprehensive, line-wise dataset of processed images and their corresponding texts, prepared specifically for training and evaluating the model.\n3. Detailed documentation and analysis of the model's performance, including improvements in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER).\nUpon acceptance, this project promises to significantly advance the field of document digitization and historical research, offering an innovative solution to a longstanding problem and enabling broader access to valuable cultural heritage.",

Many closely-related programming models exist such as CUDA and OpenCL. OpenCL is a popular framework for writing massively parallel code given its broader ecosystem and supported platforms. GIMP is a popular free open-source image manipulation tool often shipped as the default tool in many Unix-based distributions. GIMP uses GEGL internally for accelerating various image processing tasks. GEGL comes with OpenCL implementations for many operations. However, the OpenCL backend in GEGL was often slower than the baselines and resulted in incorrect outputs (and crashed sometimes). The goal of this project is to enumerate all the existing OpenCL implementations in GEGL, write a thorough suite of tests for them, and fix as many implementations as possible. If time permits and once correctness is established via tests, the project adds new faster implementations for popular operations.

          "description": "PROTACs represent a very promising emerging drug modalities. Traditional modalities, small-molecule drugs, for example, or monoclonal antibodies, are limited to certain modes of action, like targeting specific receptors or blocking particular pathways.  Due to its ability to target proteins that have been traditionally difficult to target with conventional methods, PROTACs have attracted substantial interest from both academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies, with several PROTACs currently in clinical trials for various indications, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. \n\nHowever, the exploration of PROTACs is still relatively in its infancy. With many open research questions, my proposal implements a tutorial, a common feature in DeepChem, to explore how to computational investigate PROTACs. More specifically, I provide a guide towards exploring available PROTAC datasets, developing featurization capabilities, and a multimodal sequence and structure model to infer protein degradation abilities of PROTACs, a clinically relevant  biopharmaceutical property. My  tutorial will be implemented through a Jupyter notebook which highlights the convenience and low-code capabilities of DeepChem for the scientific community. To demonstrate this, I will implement a few under-the-hood features to process available PROTAC datasets. My tutorial notebook can easily load data and build upon available models in DeepChem to develop a multimodal model for downstream inference. I hope this project provides a strong foundational understanding for researchers and the scientific community to explore computational methods for PROTAC design and optimization, possibly contributing to more effective research and development with downstream clinical benefits.  Overall, I believe this project will contribute to the overall mission of DeepChem by democratizing computational life science research for all.",

They are used in cancer checkpoint blockades, treatments for viral infection, and useful in situations of snakebites as anti-venom. Current methods of antibody discovery involve inoculating various chimeric animal constructs with specific antigens and isolating and purifying antigen-specific molecules. As such there has been a significant interest in designing antibodies in-silico. A growing number of large language models have been employed to capture the sequence distributions of these proteins, with varying degrees of success. However, the vast majority of language models are encoder-only transformers whose target-conditioned sequence generation capabilities are limited, and their code is prototypical rather than production ready. This project aims to integrate and finetune a target-conditioned LLM for eptiope-specific antibody design. Extending DeepChem's codebase to include support for this class of therapeutics would not only help democratize this technology for resource constrained operations, but also bring these groups onto a platform with a lively user base and healthy collaborative environment.",

This integration will enable DeepChem library to utilize powerful protein representations learned by ESM-2. A detailed tutorial will be written to provide not only a workflow for streamlined binding site prediction, but a guide that empowers researchers to use protein language models for further tasks within DeepChem. This project broadens DeepChem's toolbox, making it more versatile for the drug discovery community, and ultimately accelerating progress in this area. \n\nThe main deliverables are:\nA function for feature extraction using the pre-trained ESM-2 model.\nIntegration of extracted features with binding site information.\nDeepChem model architecture for protein binding site prediction.\nReports for model performance and evaluation metrics.\nTutorial documenting the complete workflow, including code, data pre-processing steps, model training details, and visualizations of predicted binding sites (if possible).\n\nIf time allows, an additional tutorial showcasing the application of ESM-2 protein representations for a different task (e.g., generating peptide binders for target proteins), or implementation of a LoRA wrapper for the ESM-2 model, along with a corresponding tutorial explaining its functionality will be developed.

          "description": "Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) is a new feature introduced in Kubernetes version 1.26 and above, providing an Alpha API that allows users to define Kubernetes objects similar to the Persistent Volumes API for generic resources. With DRA, users can separate the declaration of a resource to be consumed from its actual consumption. This move away from the limited \"countable\" API provided by device plugins allows for a more flexible control over which resources are consumed and where they are allocated.\n\nFor handling host devices, KubeVirt relies on the Kubernetes device plugin framework, which is crucial for scheduling, allocating, and attaching desired devices and resources to running pods. One limitation of this framework is the lack of persistence in device allocation when the pod is not running.\n\nThe proposed solution involves implementing the DRA plugin in KubeVirt for PCI passthrough (with Nvme devices as a Proof of Concept). A DRA driver typically consists of two separate but coordinating components: a centralized controller and a node-local kubelet plugin. The kube-scheduler communicates with the centralized controller, which makes allocation decisions based on the overall cluster state and resource availability. The kubelet-plugins are responsible for discovering and advertising the node's available resources to the kubelet.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed approach suggests enhancing the VirtualMachineInstance (VMI) resource to include resourceClaims under hostDevices. This way, users can create a VMI resource that references a ResourceClaim (Template) which in turn references a registered ResourceClass. KubeVirt components need to be modified to translate the resource claims in the VMI host devices into the PodSpec of the underlying Pod. Finally, the device driver would be deployed along with virt-handler as part of a DaemonSet.\n\nIn summary, this approach aims to leverage the DRA capabilities to enhance host devices allocation",

We have also explored optimization of end-to-end models and even navigation based on segmented images and commands (see video and project link). In this project, we would like to combine the previous acquired knowledge with LLMs, using the projects that we previously developed successfully on GSoC. The idea is to integrate an LLM system with an end-to-end autonomous driving driving model so the user can give commands in text mode directly to the vehicle, as you’d do when using a real-life taxi (“please, stop here”, “please, turn to the left in the following intersection”).

While this facilitates expressing parts of the image in terms of others, it poses challenges with large numbers of elements, making alignment difficult and memory usage proportional to the number of elements. On the other hand, immediate mode graphics represent the image as a function for drawing it. This method consumes memory proportional to the algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov complexity) of describing the image. In immediate mode, we can have a single drawing context and can be used for high volume graphics. This enhancement will allow for more interactive experiences, opening up new possibilities for creative expression and application development. Further on, we wish to add advantages of the immediate mode, while retaining the advantages of retained mode. Combining both the methods can be very crucial for the developer willing to involve both the modes in a single method.",

Leveraging user voting mechanisms, the rules governing applications can evolve dynamically, making it particularly suitable for space traffic management, an arena lacking established global regulations and in urgent need of a coordinated international agreement. Recognizing the orbit as a global commons, effective international negotiation in this context often assumes a business-oriented language.

          "description": "Indexes are baskets of stocks with specific characteristic. They provide examples for diversification in investing to mitigate the volatility of portfolios. Therefore, many investors, including institutions such as fund managers, attempt to build their portfolios to track closely major indexes. However, the effort and the transaction cost for tracking the exact constituents of indexes is not negligible, especially for indexes of many stocks (S&P500). An approach to reduce the transaction cost in index tracking is the sparse replication strategy which tries to mimic the index return through a subset of its constituents. \n\nIn this project, we implement this method through the point of view of mean-variance optimization, i.e., to minimize the tracking error as a quadratic utility function. We first replicate the study in (Shi, Shu, Tian 2020) \"High-dimensional index tracking based on the adaptive elastic net\". This means we will implement an algorithm for sparse index replication using optimization with adaptive elastic net regularization. By implementing a Python framework and exploring possible open-source optimizers, we aim to deliver to GeomScale community a new functionality of portfolio selection, which covers data parsing and preprocessing, backtesting with configurable parameters and automated fine-tuning of hyper-parameters. The next step is to test different ideas to improve this method and calibrate the hyper-parameters to fit the market condition.",

          "description": "The first genome-scale models of metabolism appeared in 1999 and 2000. In the following years fundamental Microbial Systems concepts were developed such as in silico methods and algorithms to analyze their properties. Genome-scale Metabolic models (GEMs) built on genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are capable of deciphering the complex interactions occurring in bacteria, through predictions of the possible mechanism underlying these interactions. \ndingo is a Python package that supports a variety of methods to sample from the flux space of metabolic models, based on state-of-the-art random walks and rounding methods. Aim of this project is to enhance dingo by incorporating a  preprocessing class to reduce and simplify metabolic networks, by removing certain reactions and metabolites. To identify correlated reactions, i.e. the flux of one depends on the others,  I will develop a post-processing class to calculate correlation metrics and compare pairwise reaction fluxes. \nIn the second half of the project, I will implement approaches  for building microbial communities models. Two main approaches are to be implemented: Bag of Genomes and Bag of Genes. I will develop :  a new class (“dingo.Community()”) that will  read and store a community model of two microbes based on the user’s approach of choice. Its output will be then used as input to the dingo.PolytopeSample to proceed with sampling steps. \nSampling in the community flux space with the different sampling methods already supported by dingo and benchmarking of the community modeling approaches against real data will be delivered, alongside a Google Collab notebook with unitests as tutorial. Refactoring current dingo functions to adjust the new functionality will be done too.",

This proposal represents a GeomScale project that aims to develop an algorithm for volume computation of high dimensional convex bodies that would be more efficient than those by using the new advancements in non-uniform sampling techniques. Leveraged to provide scalability and efficiency for this computationally intensive process, methods such as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) stand out for their excellent fit for such a task, where the algorithm has to deal with truncated multivariate distributions, as highlighted by Pakman and Paninski. Seamless integration within the VolEsti package is ensured using C++, which aligns with the best practices for developing high-performance mathematical software discussed by Fisikopoulos et al. \n\nThroughout this project's entire research and development process, a blog will be maintained, monitoring all the insights, challenges, optimizations, and developments that will happen.

As all humans are visual learners, to improve \nunderstanding, we will be incorporating diagrams and flowcharts to \nvisually represent data flows and function calls. This will prove very \nbeneficial for someone new to understand the codebase. \nMy proposed approach will be to further study the codebase into \nmore depth based on the sections: - \n• How a message is sent \n• How to create an endpoint \n• How to add a new service \n• How to create a DB model \n• How to use DB models \n• How services interact between them \n• How to build a lib \n• How to navigate monorepo (where is everything, how's imported, \netc) \nMy study will be focused more on analysing data flows and order in \nwhich the function calls are made. The primary focus will be on \nunderstanding the underlying purpose that justifies the presence of each \nline of code (like a conditional statement or a function invocation). These \nfindings will then be documented concisely in a flowchart for improved \nclarity. (Example POC) \nMy main deliverables will be to make the exsisting tours dynamic, that is even when when the codebase evolves, the line number of steps of tours automatically relink, create diagrams and workflows for each tours and also to create new tours or update exsisting tours",

          "description": "The End-to-End Deep Learning project within the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider plays a critical role in identifying and reconstructing single particles, jets, and event topologies in collision events. This proposal aims to leverage state-of-the-art Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to develop robust models that outperform existing supervised baselines. By exploiting unlabelled data, these SSL approaches can allow models to learn rich representations enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of particle reconstruction and identification tasks at fine-tuning stage with labelled data.\n\nI-JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) is a new approach, which aims to improve the semantic level of self-supervised representations without relying on extra prior knowledge encoded through image trans- formations. Given a context block, I-JEPA is trained predicting missing information in an abstract representation space. The targets are representation blocks obtained by dividing the input into non-overlapping patches and encoding them with a target-encoder. A subset of these representations is randomly sampled for loss computation. The context block, on the other hand, is derived from a single block randomly sampled from the input and processed through a context encoder. Overlapping regions between context and target blocks are removed to maintain a non-trivial prediction task. This approach represents a novel direction in self-supervised learning, addressing limitations of previous methods in producing high-level semantic representations suitable for various downstream tasks. I-JEPA has shown to be computationally efficient and outstanding results in image classification by linear probing its learnt representations.\n\nDeliverables:\n-Implemented SSL training pipeline.\n-SSL pre-trained model.\n-Fine tuned models on specific tasks.\n-Preprocessed datasets ready for training and evaluation.\n-Documentation covering implementation details, and experimental results",

Despite the groundbreaking nature of their research, the absence of released source code has left a significant gap in practical application and reproducibility. Furthermore, attempts by last year's contributors, Marçal Comajoan Cara and Eyup B. Unlu, to implement the Quantum Orthogonal Transformer faced challenges; Marçal encountered training issues due to NaN values, and Eyup's implementation did not proceed to the training phase of transformers, highlighting the difficulties in realizing these models.

Equivariant networks are uniquely suited for this task due to their inherent ability to handle the rotational and reflectional symmetries common in astronomical images, thus maintaining predictive accuracy regardless of orientation changes in spatial data.\r\n\r\nThe project will unfold over 175 hours, meticulously planned across several phases to ensure a thorough approach from conceptualization to deployment. Starting with a comprehensive review of current equivariant neural network architectures and their potential application in analyzing astronomical data, the project will proceed to curate a dataset from existing astronomical surveys. This dataset will include systems with known numbers of planets to serve as a foundation for model training and validation.\r\n\r\nBy developing a model that can accurately regress on the number of planets in a system, this project seeks to create a robust tool capable of adapting to the complexities inherent in observational data, such as direct images, transit data, and radial velocity measurements. The ultimate goal is to provide astronomers with a novel method for analyzing the spatial configurations of planetary systems, thereby enriching our understanding of the universe's myriad worlds.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes include a highly accurate equivariant computer vision model, comprehensive performance evaluation, and extensive documentation to support further research and potential real-world applications in exoplanet discovery and characterization.

In the realm of high-energy physics, the study of symmetries has played a pivotal role in shaping the Standard Model, which elucidates three of the four fundamental forces in nature. Recent research has showcased the efficacy of Equivariant Quantum Neural Networks (EQNNs) in leveraging symmetries within variational quantum machine learning (VQML), thereby augmenting model performance and efficiency.\n\nThis project is dedicated to delving into a spectrum of symmetries, encompassing both discrete and continuous forms, to enrich the capabilities of Equivariant Quantum Neural Networks (EQNNs). The endeavor involves crafting a comprehensive framework for constructing equivariant ansatzes tailored to diverse symmetries. By establishing such a framework, the creation and application of equivariant neural networks will be streamlined, thus facilitating their deployment in addressing challenges encountered in high-energy physics.",

It is much easy to procure unlabelled data than labelled data and ViT-MAE makes use of this unlabelled data for pre-training. Currently, there has been an increasing trend in pre-training the vision transformers on auxiliary task and then fine-tuning it for downstream tasks. This resulted in score increment of downstream tasks along with some emergent properties. With the benefits of pre-training, we would like to see how this converts to CMS data. Earlier the data has been shared either through parquet/hdf5 file format. Using ViT-MAE for compression of data would reduce the challenges associated with working with larger datasets.

Monte Carlo simulations rely on accurate probability distributions to generate meaningful results, but selecting incorrect distributions can lead to inaccuracies and require extensive computational resources. QGANs use variational quantum circuits to learn implicit probability distributions from datasets and encode them as quantum states. The quantum generator then produces synthetic data following the learned distribution, which is combined with real datasets and fed into a classical discriminator to distinguish between real and generated data. By exploiting the randomness of quantum systems, the project seeks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations.

With strong gravitational lensing, the available labeled training data is scarce, and moreover some classes have fewer samples than others. But, supervised learning require abundant labeled training data and can be biased by class imbalances in the training dataset. To circumvent this, previous works have utilized simulated lensing dataset for supervised learning. However, this approach may result in diminished performance on running inferences with real datasets.

The Machine Learning Revolution, propelled by dedicated and streamlined Neural Computation has revolutionized this field of tying particle jets to their originator particle.\r\n\r\nOver time the analytical, QCD-driven approaches for tagging have been replaced by deep-learning based approaches. Using different input representations of particle jets - particularly images, sequences, trees, sets and graphs, most notably deep neural networks (DNNs) - CNNs, RNNs etc. have been used to build new jet-tagging algorithms automatically from simulated samples (from Pythia and\r\nDelphes) and even real data.\r\nThrough this GSoC cohort, I propose a novel scheme to achieve the task of jet-tagging by exploiting\r\nthe most naturally sound, robust representation scheme - that of unordered structures of constituent particles of a jet, and methods to act upon them - namely through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that utilize attention-based/hypergraph methods to account for long-distance correlations.\r\nAfter viewing a jet as a Particle Cloud, we utilize a plethora of novel schemes and also a customized Neural Architecture to achieve learning over the dataset of Particle Jets.\r\nWe also work robustly at the inference level, extracting meaningful measures of optimality and correctness of the used approach.",

Key steps include data preprocessing, embedding generation with scGPT, and GRN inference using GENIE3. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) will be employed, comparing inferred networks against simulated ground truth or expert-curated GRNs from BEELINE.\n\nThe modular design of the pipeline allows for future integration of additional foundation models, enhancing its versatility and extendibility. This research will deepen our understanding of foundation models, particularly scGPT, in GRN inference, guiding the development of improved algorithms and methodologies for deciphering gene regulatory mechanisms from scRNA-seq data. \n\nUltimately, this work will advance biological knowledge by shedding light on gene regulatory processes and their implications across various biological contexts.",

Finally, I’ll work on improving and extending CLI functionality. The overarching goal of my work will be to significantly lower the barrier of entry for new users and developers.",

This part can be implemented using Arrow to achieve concurrent and accelerated reading. The data obtained from reading is then stored in a ring buffer, from which various parsing threads extract corresponding buffers for parsing. Finally, the parsed data is imported into the database.

          "description": "As MariaDB continues to evolve and improve, MySQL users may consider it as a better alternative. The absence of some spatial functions could be a drawback for some of them and potentially make the migration process difficult.\nMy goal is to implement the following spatial functions: ST_IsValid, ST_Validate, - MBRCoveredBy, ST_Collect, ST_GeoHash, ST_Simplify, ST_LatFromGeoHash,  ST_LatFromGeoHash and ST_PointFromGeoHash.\n\nFor each new function to implement, I will start by importing the corresponding tests from the MySQL test suite. These tests serve as an optimal starting point. Given that the primary goal is to ensure compatibility between MySQL and MariaDB, passing the same set of tests on both codebases ensures uniform behaviour. Additionally, these tests serve as a valuable supplement to the documentation, offering detailed insights into the expected behaviour of each function while also documenting edge cases. Moreover, as new tests are written when fixing a bug, we can mitigate the risk of encountering previously resolved issues by the MySQL developers.\n\nThe spatial functions already implemented, are defined in the sql/item_geofunc.h file. The new functions will also be placed in the same file and will be implemented by extending the interfaces that are already defined. For instance, ST_IsValid will extend Item_bool_func_args_geometry which is the class that defines the interface for all the MariaDB native functions returning boolean measurements of a single GEOMETRY argument.\n\nIn MySQL, the functions ST_GeoHash(longitude, latitude, max_length) and\nST_GeoHash(point, max_length) do not return a special datatype but a string. I want to make a more in-depth analysis regarding this function and evaluate if defining a\ncustom datatype would be a viable option and if it would grant meaningful performance improvements.",

          "description": "Abstract - Gutenprint is a high-quality printer driver for a wide range of inkjets, especially Epson and Canon, dye-sublimation printers and even monochrome PCL laser printers. It does not only cover many printers to give them support under Linux and free software operating systems at all, but also is optimized for highest possible print quality, so that at least on some printers and with the right settings you can even get better print quality than with the original (Windows/Mac) drivers. Right Now We only have retrofitting application that supports gutenprint so we need Native Gutenprinter application.\n\nSolution to the Problem - Here We create a native printer applcation by using pappl and libgutenprint library. Here on an incoming get-printer-attributes IPP request we call the same functions which the PPD generator calls, but instead of translating the responses into a PPD file we translate it into the IPP answer for the get-printer-attributes request. And when we have a job to print, we call the library functions which the filter calls, but directly. \n\nMy task to implement above is - \n - Create a PAPPL-based Printer Application using the libgutenprint library and PAPPL\n - Make sure all options and parameters of the Gutenprint driver are accessible from the Printer Application's web admin interface.\n - Package the Printer Application as a Snap\n\nDeliverables - My goal is to deliver a native printer application  from Gutenprint.

For example, if version A becomes corrupted, version B can be used as a backup. \n- A/B updaters support a more complete secure boot thanOSTree, which operates at the file level and is incompatible with dm-verity. \nTo address these preferences, I aim to integrate Aktualizr with SWUpdate, a widely used A/B Linux OS updater in the community. To achieve this goal, my plan involves studying SWUpdate's bootloader architecture, specifically the SWUpdate’s imager tags, and parsing for use in Aktualizr.\nThe project's deliverables include: \n- Integrating SWUpdate into the Aktualizr package manager. \n- Thoroughly testing the effectiveness of SWUpdate on real-world embedded systems.",

Aktualizr combines two important areas of functionality: implementing Uptane to actually validate software updates and then installing those software updates.

However, there are other embedded Linux OS updaters, such as SWUpdate and RAUC, that are based on an A/B partition update scheme, for which there is no support from Uptane\n\nThis GSoC project would contribute to Aktualizr's implementation of support for an A/B partition-based update method, preferably integrating with SWUpdate or RAUC.

          "description": "mesa is renowned as the premier Python framework for agent-based modeling, combining powerful functionality with ease of use. However, the framework's reliance on standard Python objects to represent agents poses scalability challenges, hindering performance as the number of agents grows. This limitation renders the execution of even modestly sized models, comprising a few thousand agents, impractical. The community has long requested a more performant version of mesa. While a refactor using Cython could address performance issues, it would introduce significant complexity and require users to adapt their methods to Cython, compromising Python's simplicity. The mesa-frames initiative proposes leveraging vectorized operations on dataframes, utilizing libraries such as pandas and polars, to enhance performance and scalability. This approach benefits from the optimized, out-of-the-box operations these libraries provide and their intuitive, well-documented APIs, which simplify custom agent creation.",

          "description": "At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), protons collide at the highest energies achieved by humanity, unravelling the particles within. To decode these collisions, scientists rely on parton density functions (PDFs), which shed light on the proton's internal makeup. \n\nThese PDFs are called millions of times in the creation of every simulated event dataset at the LHC, highlighting the necessity for improved visualization tools. Given that PDFs play a critical role yet introduce significant uncertainty in LHC research, there's a need for tools that offer clearer and more precise analysis. \n\nWe propose to develop a web dashboard and a live plotting tool focused on vizualizing PDFs. This setup will facilitate the comparison of various PDF fits and their uncertainty margins, which are crucial for the accurate interpretation of LHC results. \nOur motivation is driven by the dual role of PDFs: as indispensable tools for simulation in LHC research and as major sources of uncertainty. \n\nEnhancing visualization capabilities will allow physicists to deeply explore the differences between PDF fits and their uncertainty-variations, aiding in more accurate interpretations of LHC data.",

The notion of General Purpose GPU Programming is becoming more and more popular and it seems that the scientific community is increasingly favoring it over CPU Programming. Consequently, implementation of mathematics and operations needed for such projects are getting adjusted to GPU’s architecture. \nAutomatic differentiation is a notable concept in this context, finding applications across diverse domains from ML to Finance to Physics. Clad is a clang plugin for automatic differentiation that performs source-to-source transformation and produces a function capable of computing the derivatives of a given function at compile time. This project aims to widen Clad’s use range and audience by enabling the reverse-mode automatic differentiation of CUDA kernels.\nThe total goal of the project is to support the differentiation of CUDA kernels that may also include typical CUDA built-in objects (e.g. threadIdx, blockDim etc.), which are employed to prevent race conditions, using Clad. These produced kernels will compute the derivative of an argument specified by the user as the output based on an input parameter of their choosing.

Particles emerging from collisions create cascades of secondary particles, or showers. Describing these processes requires precise simulation methods like the Geant4 toolkit. Machine learning (ML) techniques, such as generative modeling, offer a promising alternative. Recently, the Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge (CaloChallenge) spurred the development and evaluation of different models. Also, in High-Energy Physics (HEP), there has been an increasing interest in using Julia as a language for software development, for combining the ease of programming of interactive languages, e.g. Python, with the speed of compiled languages, e.g. C++. This project targets to assess Julia's machine learning ecosystem's maturity, in terms of availability and robustness of libraries and tools for deep learning. To this end, a selection of models from the CaloChallenge will be chosen for implementation in Julia, as well as the required functionality to enable training and evaluation of the networks. Ultimately, a comprehensive analysis will be conducted between Python/C++ and Julia implementations, considering training time, inference time and evaluation metrics from CaloChallenge.",

Currently ROOT compiles all of the components available within the source code distribution. \r\nThe goal of the project is to speed up the compilation process by letting users specify which components of the ROOT will be needed. This can be done by converting ROOT’s CMake configuration into a set of “CMake External Projects” (superbuilds).  Superbuilds can remove all of this cruft from the project’s source repository, and enable you to more directly use the upstream project’s build system as an independently built software component. It is basically a simple package manager that you make consistently work across your target build platforms, and if your target platforms have a common package manager you might consider using that instead. \r\nAlso, during the configuration process it could be possible to identify if ROOT is already installed in the destination folder, the components which are already installed and offer an option to skip their compilation and use these already installed components for current compilation.\r\nWe are not going to change the build system of ROOT, but to optimize it and offer users an option to select only  the parts of the ROOT to  be built.

This initiative is motivated by the computational demands of particle physics, especially those associated with the Large Hadron Collider, which necessitates efficient and reliable software deployment across a massive, globally distributed computing grid. CVMFS (CernVM File System) plays a pivotal role in this process, serving as an optimized, POSIX-compliant read-only file system designed for user space via FUSE modules, thus facilitating software distribution.\nI propose replacing the current MacFUSE module as kernel extensions facing deprecation by Apple, with FUSE-T, a user-space module claimed to be a drop-in replacement. This transition addresses the issues with kernel extensions (kexts) and aligns with Apple's shift towards prohibition of support for them.  Such approach potentially seems to be the most user-friendly in terms of security.\nThe project involves various stages, including adapting CVMFS to use FUSE-T, benchmarking file operations, and investigating libfuse's new features like FUSE_CAP_SPLICE_MOVE. \nDeliverables include the successful integration of FUSE-T into CVMFS, benchmark reports on file operations, and an evaluation of libfuse updates.",

          "description": "In some multi-threaded algorithms, resources need to be protected using locks, but the locking mechanism may need to operate on ranges rather than individual items. For instance, imagine a scenario with a large array of N items where one task requires a small continguous subset of items to be locked while another task requires a different continguous subset. In such cases, a range-based locking mechanism is required. We need a templated range-based lock that can be applied to arrays of various types and dimensions. A successful implementation should support locking and unlocking operations on specified ranges of items and can be extended to handle multi-dimensional arrays (2D/3D, etc.) with templates that allow flexibility over dimensions and data types.",

Implementing core classes from NumPy: This subtask aims to implement key classes such as ndarray and random, along with their respective methods and functionalities. The code will be written in C++ for performance benefits. Existing C++ libraries like NumCpp (or Xtensor), which offer NumPy-like functionalities, will be leveraged for the implementation.\n2. Exposing the C++ implementation to Python through bindings: To achieve this goal, we will use a library named pybind11, a popular header only library used to generate bindings for C++ classes automatically. This step will allow users to work on a pythonic frontend and access the NumPy functionalities implemented in C++.\n\nBy the end of this summer, pocketpy seeks to offer robust array operations and random number generation capabilities, positioning it as a versatile tool for various computational tasks beyond game scripting.",

The problem at hand is the limited scope of CVE-BIN-TOOL, which currently lacks extended VEX integration, hindering its ability to provide a holistic risk assessment. The solution involves refactoring the current workflow, implementing support for various VEX formats (such as CSAF, OpenVex, and CycloneDX), establishing linkages between SBOMs and VEX formats, and updating documentation and tests for usability. Through this project, we aim to provide cybersecurity professionals with a comprehensive tool for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities effectively. The deliverables include a refined workflow, support for multiple VEX formats, documented linkage mechanisms, and updated documentation and tests.",

Based on recent guidance by the OpenSSF an effort has been made to look into implementing hardened compiler options for CPython. The phases of this project include establishing benchmarks for existing performance with current compiler options as well as the counts and types of errors. Some work has been done so far to evaluate warnings when compiling with the TL;DR compiler options provided by OpenSSF, but more research should be done to establish candidate flags. Secondly performance analysis should be generated for candidate compiler flags. Warnings should be combed for false positives since this can impact if the work should be undertaken to fix these warnings or not use the compiler flag. Once compiler options have been selected in accordance with desired safety goals, performance analysis, and additional work needed to address warnings then tooling should be implemented to track new violations relative to an existing baseline.",

          "description": "My proposal aims to increase the level of context that Pwndbg provides when stepping through a binary by “annotating” the results of instructions. Alongside the disassembled machine instructions in the dashboard, there would be text to indicate the action that each instruction takes, such as moving values between CPU registers, writing data to memory, or doing a mathematical operation. We would resolve the concrete values that memory and CPU registers take on after each instruction, providing relevant information that the user would otherwise have to fish out manually using a GDB command that varies depending on the context.\n\nPwndbg is starting to support this annotation feature for the x86 architecture. My project would add these annotations to other architectures supported by Pwndbg, namely 32-bit Arm, 64-bit Arm, RISC-V, and MIPS. This not only aids in debugging and reverse engineering, as you would gain much-needed context as to the results of instructions, but there is also an educational benefit in that you can visually see what each instruction is doing while stepping through a binary.\n\nWe would additionally create annotations for future instructions in the disassembly view using emulation. By combining the Unicorn Engine, a CPU emulator framework, with the Capstone Engine, a disassembly framework, we can provide the user with insight into the next handful of instructions, providing more context and increasing debugging efficiency. \n\nDeliverable\n- A series of pull requests which add annotations for instructions for Arm, AArch64, RISC-V, and MIPS inside the “disassembly” view of the Pwndbg dashboard\n- A rewrite of the parent class API to make adding annotations to new architectures more simple\n- Add the ability for the recursive printing of pointers inside the annotations to provide enhanced information on pointers inside heap memory, such as internal heap manager metadata\n- Documentation and tests to aid future contributors and reduce chance of regressions",

          "description": "Effective connectivity analyses are a staple of many neurophysiological research projects, providing key insights into the healthy functioning of the brain and pathological alterations with disease. MNE-Connectivity leverages the API of the highly-popular MNE-Python signal processing package to provide tools for computing such connectivity. However, given the complexities associated with studying interactions in the brain, it is critical that the metrics for estimating connectivity are robust, and the estimates themselves statistically significant. Naturally, it is essential that such tools are available in open-source toolboxes, something we will address in this project. First, building on recent work in the MNE-Connectivity toolbox, we will implement further support for advanced multivariate connectivity metrics in the form of a dedicated decoding module. This module will provide flexible tools for the data-driven analysis of connectivity that is critical for robust characterisations of network activity in multi-channel recordings. The only comparable implementations of such methods are in toolboxes for the proprietary language MATLAB, limiting the availability of these tools to the wider research community. Second, we will expand the existing set of statistical features available in MNE-Python to include tools for assessing the statistical significance of estimated connectivity, crucial for distinguishing genuine interactions from background noise. In all cases, new features will be complemented with detailed examples and tutorials in the MNE-Connectivity documentation. Altogether, the project will expand the repertoire and quality of open-source tools available for studying connectivity in the brain, a cornerstone of modern neurophysiological research.",

Furthermore, there is a focus on developing features to provide comprehensive reporting of findings, including overall score, successful and failed attacks, attack success rate, actionable recommendations, and detailed reports. Moreover, there are plans to expand the scope of honeypots analyzed by integrating additional ones such as Amun, Glastopf, and MongoDB-HoneyProxy. Another objective that this project aims for if time is given is research and implementation of various other honeypot detection techniques to bolster the tool's effectiveness in identifying security vulnerabilities with attacks like Metascan-Based Fingerprinting, HTTP Static Response checking, and even Static Command Responses.",

While manually serializing the data structure can avoid these allocation overheads, we prefer not to maintain hand-written marshal/unmarshal code. The upcoming Remote-write-2.0 (rw2.0) will address these memory allocation overheads. By pushing for rw2.0 alongside migrating to vtproto, we can utilize a better-maintained library and eliminate this allocation if rw2.0 is adopted quickly.

A user can send a signal to the process (pidfd_send_signal syscall), wait for the process (poll() on pidfd) using a pidfd. However, with the current implementation of CRIU, it can't checkpoint/restore a process with pidfd file descriptor(s) opened. So, the proposed project's purpose is to add new functionality to successfully checkpoint/restore any process that has opened pidfd file descriptor(s).",

These policies will enable users to efficiently manage checkpoint resources, preventing operational challenges and resource exhaustion.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nCurrent container checkpoint management lacks advanced and flexible garbage collection policies. This results in operational inefficiencies and resource wastage.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nEnhance the existing Kubernetes operator with advanced garbage collection policies. These policies will empower users to define how checkpoints are managed at different levels (global, per-namespace, per-pod, per-container), ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing operational challenges.\n\nKey Deliverables:\n\nGarbage Collection Policies:\n1. Implement dynamic checkpoint threshold policy for fine-grained control over checkpoint management.\n2. Introduce orphaned checkpoint cleanup policy to remove obsolete checkpoints.\n3. Implement time-based checkpoint retention policy for automatic deletion of outdated checkpoints.\n\nAutomated Checkpoint Management (Optional):\n1. Automate checkpoint lifecycle management, including creation, replacement, and deletion.\n2. Enforce storage quotas and monitor storage utilization.\n3. Collect metrics, enable alerting, and implement event logging for proactive management.\n\nImpact:\n\nThe implementation of these garbage collection policies will enable users to manage different container's(pod's, namespace's) checkpoint with different garbage collection policies. It will optimize resource utilization, and enhance operational efficiency.\n\nNote: Optional functionalities such as automated checkpoint management will be considered based on available time and project priorities.",

I propose evaluate these flag in parallel. This approach allows multiple flag evaluations to be performed concurrently, potentially improving performance compared to sequential evaluation. Furthermore, the module currently having methods with multiple database calls, such as saving multiple flags using a for loop, causing system slowdowns. To address this issue, I aim to reduce database calls through batch saving. The patient flag module does not compatibility with Java 11 and Java 17 and this module need to update to meet the current openmrs standards.

The goal is to make the migration invisible to the client, causing only a period of service unavailability, after which communication can be resumed without re-establishing the TCP connection.

For each package, I will add thorough benchmarks, comprehensive test suites, examples, and a README containing the API signatures for the routine in multiple languages, along with the ndarray case. I will also add the docs folder, which houses a repl.txt file, a typescript file that provides introductions, usage instructions to aid in documentation, and other files to check cases where the function may become invalid. A cblas wrapper will also be added for devices with support for cblas, such as AppleAccelerators, for hardware-optimized performance.\n\nThis implementation will open doors for domains such as time series analysis or linear algebra operations such as SVD that are built on top of these BLAS routines. A comprehensive suite of BLAS routine APIs will be incorporated into stdlib, and the integration of C and Fortran implementations will aim at optimizing performance and enabling potential hardware-based implementations.",

Everybody can manage the system with Pirania UI. each router has access to the Captive Portal system and this makes it be distributed and extremely used in a community and of different types of governance. Pirania has different options of governance, this means that each community can understand the best use that it can make with the system and different cases of use. but for it to be more complete it is important to raise the different ideas that have already been raised by the community. And after the latest versions of lime-packages, pirania is not included, mainly because the basis of pirania’s operation is the iptables rules contained in ./usr/bin/captive-portal. As iptables ends up creating a very large file, the new version of libremesh decided to migrate from iptables to nftables. This and other changes need to be made to fit pirania into a new release.",

          "description": "When a community network router ethernet port is acting as a gateway to the Internet or as a border to neighboring networks, the network configuration usually needs to be changed from the default settings to accommodate for the specific role.\nA router ethernet port can be connected to the Internet, or connected to a dummy wifi device for a point to point link, or connected to another router of the same mesh network to expand mesh coverage. All these cases would benefit of specific configuration.\nAs of today handling those configuration manually represents a barrier for communities without technical experts who could understand and optimize the devices ethernet ports configuration appropriately. Most of the described situation could be detected at runtime through automatic tests and the required configuration applied automatically, the goal of this project is to develop the software needed to accomplish automatically to the described needs.",

While the user space will parse OpenWrt Firewall rules and pass them through a BPF map to the eBPF program, the eBPF program will parse incoming packages, apply the rules for matching packages, and redirect or drop the package.\n\n\nBenefits to community networks\n\nThe OpenWrt community could possibly benefit from higher throughput for traffic on their (CPU-limited) embedded devices. Especially since current WiFi chips are going to provide above 1GBit/s wireless throughput, the need for an efficient data plan for rule-based packet processing (forwarding, mangling, and dropping) is needed. Within this project, we address this with the offloading capabilities from eBPF within the Linux network stack.\n\n\nMilestones\n\n * Creation of an eBPF package forwarder\n * Creation of a user space program for loading and communicating with the eBPF program\n * Extend the user space program with a Firewall rule parser\n * Apply the parsed rules on incoming packages in the eBPF program\n * Evaluate the performance of the implementation (XDP and TC)",

          "description": "This project aims to enhance the bioframe library developed by Open2C, an organization that creates software for analyzing genomic data. A key focus will be expanding the bioframe API to access genome assembly metadata from additional providers like Ensembl and NCBI, enabling more comprehensive data integration. The API will also be extended with efficient query methods similar to the existing UCSC class. Furthermore, the project will explore using the Rust-based polars package as a potential replacement for pandas in bioframe, with the goal of improving memory efficiency and runtime performance for dataframe operations. Bioframe's core modules will be rebuilt using polars, and benchmarking will be conducted to evaluate performance gains. If successful, the polars implementation will be extended to the entire bioframe package and related functions in other Open2C tools that currently utilize pandas and bioframe methods.",

Users can perform essential tasks like intersection, union, subtraction and merging of genomic intervals and resolving overlaps, crucial for downstream analyses. BioFrame empowers researchers to streamline their genomic data processing tasks. With its open-source nature, BioFrame encourages collaboration and community-driven development, fostering innovation in genomic data analysis.\nThe project aims to develop comprehensive tutorials using Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the usage of the BioFrame Python library, focusing on real-world user cases using publicly available genomic data from in vitro experiments. Each tutorial will cover a diverse range of genomic analysis scenarios, including but not limited to ChIP-seq analysis, identification of regulatory elements, and structural variation exploration. By utilizing publicly available in vitro genomic datasets, users will have access to high-quality data for hands-on learning and they will gain practical insights into leveraging BioFrame for efficient manipulation and analysis of genomic intervals. The tutorials will provide step-by-step guidance, from data loading to advanced interval-based operations, ensuring users of all skill levels can easily follow along and they will showcase the integration of BioFrame with other Python libraries commonly used in bioinformatics workflows, enhancing users' understanding of its interoperability. These tutorials will be published on GitHub pages, ensuring easy access and facilitating community collaboration and feedback on the tutorial content.

Floating point numbers only approximate the real numbers, which can lead to accumulation of errors and ultimately to unusable results.\n\nCurrent state of the art of floating point arithmetic optimization is done in Rust (egg)\nor Racket (Herbie). This is not very accessible for the actual target group\nof scientists & engineers who are used to program in high-level languages such as Python, MATLAB and Julia.\nAdditionally, it requires manual labour (rewriting symbolic expressions, then\noptimizing them, and finally translating the resulting code back to the\noriginal language) due to the necessity of interfaces to interoperate between different systems written in different languages.\nWe propose to take advantage of Julia's homoiconicity and powerful existing symbolic-numeric ecosystem to implement an automatic floating point expression optimizer in Julia, acting on any expression that supports TermInterface.jl, such as Symbolics.jl expressions as well as native Julia code.\n\nThe project will include a package that implements the floating point expression optimization apporach (OptiFloat.jl). To achieve this Metatheory.jl will be fully integrated with Symbolics.jl, enabling e-graph based optimization of any symbolic expression (not just numerical). Additionally we will finalize the release of Metatheory.jl v3.0,\nidentify existing Julia packages that may suffer from numerical error propagation, and perform a thorough comparison of automatically optimized expressions vs. original vs. external system including the time required to obtain them.",

          "description": "PolyPhy is an advanced toolkit utilizing the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) algorithm for reconstructing networks from sparse 2D or 3D data. The current web portal for it faces challenges with limited content management, ineffective multi-platform connectivity, and performance issues, hindering its potential for wider reach and user engagement. To address these challenges, the proposal aims to implement a Modern CMS, streamlining content management to facilitate efficient updates to new materials, use cases, and publications, especially beneficial for PolyPhy's community. Additionally, code refactoring will improve and optimize the existing codebase, enhancing performance, scalability, and maintainability. Furthermore, enabling Multi-Platform Integration by integrating with APIs for LinkedIn, Twitter, and email will automate update dissemination, ensuring consistency and timeliness. These improvements will not only enhance the overall user experience but also establish a solid foundation for PolyPhy's growth and impact in the community.",

          "description": "LLM hallucinations have been tackled with various retrieval techniques (e.g. RAGs), which show that non-parametric memory with a ranker (knowledge graphs, databases, etc.), when combined with the existing parametric memory of LLMs, helps generate less factually incorrect information. However, hallucination explainability still remains unsolved [1], especially on logical reasoning tasks. We aim to conduct a first-of-its-kind study that utilizes Prolog knowledge-base rules with human feedback to develop a neuro-symbolic approach in explaining hallucinations in large language models. To achieve this, we aim to first build an initial graphical user interaction (GUI) tool that collects user feedback and takes into account a triple-pair <llm-output, prolog-kb-info, human-feedback-score> along with qualitative human feedback for processing. We also build a pipeline for storing the feedback data to a secure database, which eventually can be used to adjust the weights of the reward model of the LLMs.",

Traditional autograding systems often provide generic feedback, which may not be sufficient for students to grasp the root causes of their errors and improve their coding skills effectively.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, the project proposes the development of a sophisticated system that can analyze code submissions comprehensively. This system will consist of custom drivers designed for each programming problem, capable of detecting various types of errors and providing tailored explanations for them. These explanations will cover not only low-level syntax errors but also higher-level issues such as algorithmic design flaws or incorrect usage of data structures.\n\nMoreover, the project includes the creation of an intuitive interface with a structured roadmap covering programming topics from basic to advanced levels. This interface will offer a gamified learning experience, complete with progress indicators and visual feedback mechanisms to keep users engaged and motivated. By integrating the custom drivers and feedback pipeline into this interface, the project aims to provide a seamless learning experience for users at all skill levels.\n\nUtilizing open-source tools like Monaco code editor and Judge0 for code execution ensures compatibility and accessibility across different platforms. Additionally, the project emphasizes continuous feedback and refinement through interactions with mentors, instructors, and users. This iterative approach allows for the continuous improvement of the system, ensuring its effectiveness in assisting learners in understanding programming concepts and improving their coding skills.",

          "description": "I propose to work on the creation of a DMA-BUF backend for waycrate’s libwayshot screen capture library. Presently libwayshot’s method of screen-capture requires copying from graphics memory to system memory via CPU using the shared memory methods of the wlr-screencopy protocol. This method has too much overhead for uses like high resolution streaming: any further transforms and processing of the image will either be performed on CPU (inefficient) or require another copy back onto graphics memory. There is a better way to do this.\n\nThe DMA-BUF (short for Direct Memory Access Buffer) is a Linux kernel framework that allows for efficiently sharing buffers of memory between multiple graphics devices or subsystems. Using the DMA-BUF export mechanisms in wlroots we can completely avoid downloads and uploads between graphics memory and the CPU, thus allowing for increased efficiency and performance. This will be especially noticeable on higher resolution screen-captures where individual frame buffers become too large to be efficiently dealt with on a CPU compared to how they can be handled on the GPU.\n\nThe Deliverables for this project are: Complete implementation of a high-performance DMA-BUF based screen capture backend in libwayshot, Documentation for using it.",

          "description": "The Web Audio API’s AudioWorklet (AW) is a powerful and flexible framework for browser-based synthesis and DSP. It’s been used in many full-featured web audio projects and allows for high-performance audio code and fine-grained control. For new users interested in AW, there is a steep learning curve and much boilerplate is needed to use AW. Adding to Chrome’s AW examples, I propose a web-based AW DSP Playground that allows users to rapidly prototype in the AW paradigm and explore browser-based DSP. With an interactive editor, dynamic generation of AW boilerplate, modifiable examples, and visualizations of DSP audio, this simplifies and helps users create and learn AudioWorklets for browser-based audio synthesis.  \n\n///\n\nIn addition to the DSP playground project, I propose building an AW Live Test Suite, a page for running AW verification and performance tests. Currently, AW tests are run on automated test runners but there is much need to test functionality locally in the browser. A live test suite would allow for quick developer verification, backward compatibility checks, and performance benchmarking on local browsers and hardware. By creating a custom testing framework for AW, AW testing is faster and more accessible for Chromium developers, useful for production monitoring and Canary development.",

Given its unique ability to allow developers to run code in a worker thread, AudioWorklets allow for real-time high-performance sound processing that also does not block the main thread’s execution in potentially computationally-expensive tasks. I propose creating a specialized IDE tailored for AudioWorklet development. Inspired by existing web-based IDEs like FaustIDE and WebChucK, it aims to streamline the process of creating processors. The proposed IDE would offer features such as importing code from AudioWorklet examples, providing GUI elements for visualization, and integrating tools for testing code, including precise test cases and a graphical editor for audio graphing. The goal is to enhance user experience and facilitate the creation and testing of AudioWorklet implementations.",

Specifically, they offer resilience against broker outages, which is vital for system stability. However, the use of RADOS queues to support persistent notifications comes with its drawbacks. Not only does it impose additional strain on the RADOS cluster, but it also renders the system non-functional in environments lacking a RADOS backend.\nIn this project we propose the implementation of persistent bucket notifications within the RADOS Gateway, leveraging a Redis Queue instead. This approach offers several advantages, including compatibility with various backends such as posix, dbstore, and daos, facilitated by integrating with the \"zipper\" project.

As the situation stands for Lua stack trace, it does not store any line number information for any native C call, which Pallene eventually ends up using. There are also missing traces when a Pallene function calls another Pallene function as the call is in Pallene environment and completely oblivious to Lua.\n\n\nThis proposal aims to fix that issue in Pallene, improving its overall debugging support.",

Currently, KDS lacks a visual testing service leading to manual effort in validating UI modifications. Leveraging tools like Puppeteer and Percy, the project proposes to automate the process of capturing and comparing screenshots of UI components before and after modifications, ensuring consistency and correctness.\nKey deliverables of the project are:  1. Integration of Percy into the existing Jest test suite, 2. Implementing visual testing for at least one UI component, 3. Establishing a mechanism for surfacing visual differences in pull requests. \nThis will help enhance the efficiency and reliability of KDS development, fostering a consistent and polished user experience across Kolibri products.",

          "description": "Instructors face significant challenges when configuring autograding systems for their courses due to limited examples, insufficient documentation, and a lack of coverage for various features. To address these issues, I propose a comprehensive solution aimed at reducing the learning curve for instructors and enhancing the functionality of autograding systems. The project focuses on three primary areas: Firstly, I aim to improve autograding examples by creating tailored solutions for specific use cases, such as evaluating compilation speed and handling distributed/networked applications. These examples will feature detailed configurations in config.json, accompanied by comprehensive documentation. Additionally, existing examples will be revamped to meet current standards and encompass a broader range of programming languages and features. Secondly, I will enhance documentation and provide illustrative examples for new autograding features that lack proper guidance. Through thorough research and collaboration with mentors, I will develop demonstrations for features like generating random input/output and utilizing customized Docker containers. The aim is to facilitate understanding and usage of these features by instructors. Lastly, to provide instructors with a user-friendly platform for configuring autograding across various educational levels, I will establish a structured repository. This repository will house a diverse array of autograding examples organized by educational level, ranging from introductory to advanced courses. Furthermore, I will encourage crowd-sourced contributions to create a comprehensive collection of programming assignments and exercises, complete with their autograding configurations. To streamline the contribution process and ensure consistency in configurations, I will implement GitHub Workflow Actions. The repository will include detailed documentation and guidelines to facilitate contribution and usage.",

Ratings are utilized to recommend books and attract new readers. Traditional rating mechanisms can provide a quick snapshot of public opinion, but they often lack depth, context, and reliability, making them less effective for making choices. Opiniated response, limited context, fake ratings impact on average are some of the disadvantages.\n\nSolution: Above problem can be solved by introducing book battles as an alternative to gather feedback from the reader. A reader can submit a battle of two books and choose the better one also giving reason as comment. \nKey features:\n1. less subjective as battles are based on comparison of two books.\n2. Comments on battles can provide more context about a book.\n3. Each battle weighs equally hence fake battles are less impactful as compared to fake ratings.\n4. Author/Publisher can improve the book by reading comments.\n5. books won’t get absolute ratings without comparisons\nImplementation: open library website\n\nTOC based search and indexing.\n\nProblem: Traditional search systems typically allow users to search for books by specific criteria such as title, author, or genre. However, these systems may not always cater to users who are interested in finding books related to a specific topic or subject matter, especially if they are not familiar with the titles or authors of relevant books.\n\nSolution: Table of content-based indexing and searching is a feature that enhances the search capabilities of our search system by utilizing the content structure of books. \nKey features:\n1.

With the increasing traffic and diverse services, 5G NR has been developed and is supported in ns-3 via 5G-LENA. However, there's a need for more reinforcement learning examples based on NR. Additionally, improving the ease of use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches aims to enhance the usability of NR Sidelink, enabling distributed operations.\n\nIn this project, I will improve the interface between OpenGymEnv in ns3 and ns3env in the Python ns3 gym module for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Currently, ns3gym utilizes the REQ-REP pattern in ZeroMQ as the interface. By incorporating techniques such as client identity and parallel processing of workers in ZMQ, I aim to develop a MARL interface in ns3gym. Additionally, I will enhance the usability of 5G by implementing MARL approaches in 5G examples, with a specific focus on 5G LENA.",

This improves the contributor's change description, enhancing release notes. We may also utilize LLMs to improve the contributors' change descriptions further.\n\n2—Currently, Synfig is bundled to work on Linux using AppImage v1.0 scripts. AppImage v1.0 is outdated and has the critical issue that it doesn't work smoothly on newer systems (Ubuntu v22.04 and others); in this project, the AppImage scripts will be updated to use the latest AppImage version to run smoothly on newer Linux distribution versions and potentially write scripts for automated Debian and Flatpak packages which will offer new Synfig artists flexibility for downloading Synfig on Linux.",

The strategy employed is known as the Zero Cost strategy, which aims to minimise the impact on the main program execution path. It achieves this by pushing all exception handling operations into separate side tables, thus avoiding any potential negative effects on the instruction cache.\nWhen an exception is caught, GCC utilises DWARF information to unwind the stack, allowing the program to resume execution at the appropriate point. However, one current limitation is that GCC does not track the specific type of exception that is thrown.\nThis project aims to improve the nothrow detection in GCC which will allow to eliminate the dead exception handling regions and thus optimise the intermediate code generated.",

          "description": "Users often encounter calls, SMS messages, and links across various mobile platforms, including browsers, social media, and messaging apps. However, when doubts arise regarding the legitimacy of these communications, such as suspicions of phishing attacks or the presence of malicious links, users currently lack a dedicated platform for submitting and reviewing such content. This absence of a centralized platform leaves users vulnerable to potential threats, as they lack a reliable mechanism to report and verify suspicious communications. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the development of a dedicated platform where users can submit calls, SMS messages, and links for review by trusted authorities or community members. Such a platform would empower users to proactively address security concerns, enhance collective awareness of potential threats, and contribute to the creation of a safer digital environment for all mobile users. \n\nTo address this pressing issue, we propose the development of a comprehensive mobile application equipped with automatic detection capabilities tailored to identify and mitigate spams and scams. In addition to its automated features, the application empowers users to manually contribute instances of suspicious content encountered on diverse platforms, fostering a community-driven approach to combating online fraud. Complementing the mobile app, a dedicated web application will cater to administrative users, providing them with the tools and resources needed to conduct thorough reviews of reported instances. Through a systematic review process, pertinent information about identified spams and scams will be meticulously documented and stored in a secure database, facilitating further analysis and informing future detection strategies.",

WebGPU, a modern web standard and API, provides low-level, high-performance access to a device's GPU through web browsers. It aims to enable developers to create complex graphical applications and experiences on the web by utilizing modern GPU hardware for efficient graphics rendering. Due to their extensive usage and customized optimizations, current Federated Learning (FL) systems frequently concentrate on certain device types, such as smartphones or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Nevertheless, FL's adaptability to other device kinds may be limited by this device-centric optimization, necessitating substantial coding and redesign work to modify FL systems for diverse device types. Because developers wind up building different and fragmented codebases for each device, this method violates software engineering principles of code reusability, making maintenance more difficult and impeding the effective deployment of FL. In this proposal, a novel WebGPU based federated learning network for heterogeneous device network is proposed.

          "description": "This proposal seeks to enrich the mlpack library by incorporating advanced evolutionary strategies, specifically focusing on enhancing the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) through the integration of Increasing POPulation size CMA-ES (IPOP-CMA-ES) and Self-Adaptive Surrogate-Assisted CMA-ES (saACM-ES). The core of this initiative is to tackle complex optimization problems more effectively by leveraging these sophisticated variants.\r\n\r\nCMA-ES is celebrated for its adaptability and effectiveness in dealing with real-world optimization challenges by dynamically adjusting the search distribution. To augment this capability, the IPOP-CMA-ES variant introduces a restart mechanism with an increasing population size, aimed at improving the algorithm's ability to escape local optima and discover the global optimum in multimodal functions. Further enhancing the CMA-ES framework, the saACM-ES variant employs a surrogate model to approximate the objective function's landscape, significantly reducing the computational expense of function evaluations.\r\n\r\nThe project is structured around three pivotal deliverables to ensure a clear, measurable progression. Initially, by week 6, the IPOP mechanism will be fully integrated, accompanied by comprehensive tests and documentation. Following this, the saACM-ES strategy will be implemented by week 10, ensuring its reliability and efficiency through extensive testing and well-detailed documentation. The final stage, culminating in week 12, involves refining the implementations, enhancing documentation, and showcasing the new capabilities through examples. This comprehensive approach aims not only to bolster mlpack’s suite of algorithms but also to pave the way for future innovations within the library.",

Achieving this goal will improve the accessibility and reusability of data generated by simulations by allowing analysis of trajectories on computers with only modest disk and memory sizes. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the Zarrtraj reader and writer show promise as performant and flexible solutions to the MDAnalysis streaming goal. However, the current solution suffers from some limitations. First, although both are constructed in such a way that theoretically allow usage with any arbitrary Zarr storage type, there will inevitably be challenges in practice, creating a need for comprehensive tests of zarrtraj files with different storage backends. Second, the cached reading approach currently doesn’t support random access of trajectory datasets. Third, the writer doesn’t support anything beyond a single-machine setup in parallel writing.\r\n\r\nGiven the above limitations of the current solution, the goals of this GSOC project will be to enhance the Zarrtraj MDAkit with the following improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Using Pytest alongside moto (for AWS), azurite (for Azure), and google cloud emulators to test and debug Zarrtraj cloud streaming with the goal of achieving 100% tests passing for synthetic and real trajectories.\r\n2. Achieving 90% overall test coverage in the Zarrtraj repository.\r\n3.  Modifying the ZarrTrajReader to use information from a FrameIterator object to construct a better caching strategy in which the cache is filled with the next frames the user wants to read that fit in the buffer via parallel read rather than filling the buffer only with sequential frames. \r\n4.

OpenBabel is a popular toolbox for chemical molecular modelling as it enables searching, conversions, analysis and data storage. The ability to interconvert chemical file formats with OpenBabel, in particular, opens up the ability to utilise and work with other packages, as OpenBabel enables input and writing of over 100 chemical data file formats. Therefore, expanding to OpenBabel will hugely increase the ability of MDAnalysis to handle a variety of data formats and encourage greater adoption of MDAnalysis as an “all-in-one” package for molecular dynamics analysis.\n\n\nThe converters already established in the MDAnalysis package for OpenMM, ParmED and RDKit either read coordinate files into their respective objects before using them to create a MDAnalysis Universe or convert Universes in the reverse direction. I plan to take a similar approach to these existing converters. I will utilise OpenBabel Python bindings to make my task of introducing interoperability much easier, since Python code in the MDAnalysis package can easily access OpenBabel attributes (as long as the user has installed OpenBabel in an appropriate directory). I will start with conversion of MDAnalysis AtomGroup objects to OpenBabel OBMol objects, then work on conversion in the reverse direction. This means access to alternative formats and file type export options will be prioritised. Then, I will create a second converter file to convert OpenBabel OBMols to MDAnalysis Topologies, or adds them  to a pre-existing Topology.",

My approach leverages the integration of complex glyphs, combining multiple time series plots with coloured heat maps. This method effectively demonstrates the potential for a more informative and comprehensive data representation. To tackle the identified inefficiency and time-consuming nature of the current process, the proposed toolkit will streamline the method of annotating multiple datasets onto a map, making it significantly more efficient and user-friendly.\n\nThe deliverables of this proposal are threefold. First, the development of a toolkit that extends the Glyph mapping technique to include the visualization of high-dimensional data, allowing for a broader range of data types and insights to be visualized. Second, a streamlined process for annotating multiple datasets onto a map efficiently, addressing the current inefficiencies and making the technique more practical for widespread use.

This is achieved by visualizing low(er) dimensional projections of the data. As tours aren’t just singular projections, but rather sequences of projections, an integral part of the tourr package focuses on animating tours. In its current implementation, the package doesn't offer interactivity to guide the tours towards projections of particular interest. Previous efforts have been made to add interactivity; however, the resulting software suffered from performance issues or didn't provide the desired level of interactivity. Python packages such as matplotlib or tkinter offer the desired interactivity at a high efficiency. \n\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop software that seamlessly integrates the interactivity available through Python with the tourr package written in R. To achieve that, the packages reticulate and rpy2, which provide tools for interoperability between Python and R, will be used.

While LLVM/Clang supports various GPU programming interfaces, LLVM IR hinders effective analysis for GPU code with its SIMT model. Clang's mid-level IR (ClangIR) based on MLIR is better suited to capture this information from source code.\n\nThis project proposes adding basic OpenCL C support to ClangIR.\n\nChallenges and Solutions:\n\n1.

Migrating existing CodeGen code to the Lowering framework could be complex.\nWe will actively debate the trade-off between optimization potential and implementation complexity to propose and execute well-designed, achievable plans.\n\n2. Scattered OpenCL Support Code: Current OpenCL support code is dispersed throughout the codebase, hindering development quality control.\nStrategies will be developed to address this issue, such as extracting key information from flags like getLangOpts().OpenCL and getOpenCLRuntime(), or implementing systematic code searches to consolidate functionalities and address issues in a structured manner.\n\nThe final deliverables of this project include\n\na) A set of testcases that combines unit tests with integration tests\nb) An AST Consumer for OpenCL C (extension of CIRGen)\nc) A set of MLIR Passes for properly generating SPIR Kernels\nd) A functional and performance test report (optional)\ne) Detailed development documentation for all the above parts",

By conducting a statistical analysis on IR files available on the LLVM ComPile dataset, outlying files that yield unexpected compilation times can be detected. Python scripts will assist in the extraction and subsequent analysis of the IR files at multiple optimization levels. Identification of those outlying files will lead to an analysis of features in or related to the IR using available tools for analyzing LLVM code. Available flags for the compiler of a given language, say Clang, can be used to identify statistics, such as pass times, related to the compilation pipeline. Pinpointing what features are specific to code compilation, such as certain passes, and how IR features relate to the compilation pipeline will inform compiler implementers and LLVM developers as to what specifically causes an unexpected compilation time. Implementers can then modify the compilers accordingly, and developers can write code in conformance with specific programming structures, in order to minimize compilation times.",

See https://discourse.llvm.org/t/libc-gsoc-2024-half-precision-in-llvm-libc/77027.\n\nThe IEEE 754 binary16 format (also known as “half precision”) has most recently gained popularity in machine learning, which often does not require higher precision, and can benefit from increased performance when using smaller data types. It has been standardized as the _Float16 type in the drafts of the C23 standard. This project aims to implement support for this new floating-point data type and the associated variants of the C library’s math functions, in LLVM’s libc.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n1. Add support for usage of the new type in generated headers through the float16 alias on supported compilers, compiler versions, and architectures.\n2. Add generic implementations of the C23 half precision basic math operations for supported architectures.\n3. Add possible specialized, higher-performance implementations of the C23 half precision basic math operations for individual supported architectures using hardware instructions and compiler builtins.\n4. Add generic implementations of C23 half precision higher math functions for supported architectures. (Not all higher math functions can be implemented in the amount of time we have.)",

I just copy and paste here.\n\nShort description: Automatic1111 is a powerful web user interface based on Gradio library specifically designed for Stable Diffusion. It’s most popular open-source Stable Diffusion WebUI on GitHub with 119K+ stars, which supports a lot of features like text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting, Lora models, custom models from model hubs like civitai.com and huggingface etc. OpenVINO support for Automatic1111 enables Stable Diffusion run on Intel CPUs and GPUs, this solution is currently supported using a custom script. Implementing OpenVINO through the Automatic1111 extension will provide an easier way to use OpenVINO. This project will also aim to provide support for more AUTOMATIC111 features with OpenVINO. Task Description:\n\nDevelop a built-in extension for Automatic1111 SD WebUI based on the existing OpenVINO custom script leveraging Diffusers library.\nSupport some of the new features like Hires upscalers, new samplers, tiling, face restoration etc. Develop test scripts to evaluate these features.\nEvaluate with different Stable Diffusion variants (V1.5, V2.1, XL, LCM etc.) on Intel CPUs and GPUs.\nOptional: Evaluate compatibility with other extensions like ControlNet.\nExpected outcomes:\n\nRaise a PR with all the contributions to the OpenVINO fork and eventually to the mainstream Automatic1111 repo.\nDocumentation with clear description of features in the extension and demo videos.\nMedium/OpenVINO blogs.",

          "description": "Flax/JAX is a new solution for training models, that provides much faster training than TensorFlow and PyTorch. So we should expect increase in amount of Flax/Jax models. However, OpenVINO currently supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, PDPD models but it lacks of native support for JAX models. Not all JAX models can be exported to TensorFlow SavedModel format. So there exists of a problem for native and direct support for JAX models without intermediate format usage. The implemented functionality should include logic for parsing traced JAX objects, translators for conversion basic JAX operations into OpenVINO opset decompositions. The functionality should be relied and inherit common FE API so that it will be possible to convert JAX models using ovc.convert_model. The feature should be extendable in the future by others (OV team and open-source community) to support new JAX operations and models. The goal is to implement a prototype with basic functionality to support fundamental models (ResNet, BERT) trained with JAX.      \n\n\n\nMy plan will include the following steps:\n1. Add a python wrapper to get the Jaxpr and deal with it by OpenVINO.\n2. Register a compiler to Jaxpr which returns a compiled executable.\n3. Add a Jaxpr interpreter to customize the lowering and evaluation.\n4. Write the backbone of the JAX frontend, including the decoder, node, translation, model conversion and operations.\n5. Add unit tests for the newly added frontend.\n6. Add examples as showcase and add required operations.      \n\n\n\nThe expected deliverables are listed below:\n* showcases with supporting Flax/JAX (Mindspore) models (ResNet, Bert) by OpenVINO\n* implementation of the prototype and merge it into the master\n* Documentation of JAX frontend\n* (optional) support models in Pynative mode for dynamic computation",

          "description": "The Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) Android app currently offers a range of scientific instruments for on-the-go data collection and analysis. However, there's a pressing need to enhance the functionality of the oscilloscope feature and introduce support for new instruments, so that it attains equivalence to the dedicated devices. This proposal aims to address these issues by updating the oscilloscope module with advanced features and integrating support for additional instruments. The existing oscilloscope feature in the PSLab Android app lacks certain functionalities crucial for comprehensive data analysis, hindering users' ability to conduct precise experiments or measurements. Furthermore, the absence of support for new instruments limits the versatility of the app. To solve these challenges, a two-fold approach is proposed. Firstly, the oscilloscope will be updated to enhance waveform visualization, integrate automated measurements, and implement advanced triggering options. Secondly, support for new instruments will be implemented by identifying key scientific instruments, developing drivers and interfaces for seamless integration, and enhancing the user interface. Upon project completion, the deliverables will include enhanced oscilloscope functionality integration, smooth operation across all oscilloscope channels, implementation and calibration of designated sensors, integration and operation of other I2C compatible sensors, and comprehensive unit testing for all newly implemented features.",

These modules are crucial for simulating multi-body dynamics, a field of particular relevance to my studies and work as a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at TU Delft. Despite their capabilities, there's a significant opportunity to improve these modules by introducing new methods for Equations of Motion (EoM) generation and by optimizing existing implementations.\n\nProblem Statement:\nCurrent methods for EoM generation within SymPy, while powerful, show inefficiencies that can hinder performance and usability, especially in complex simulations. Additionally, there's a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate and improve these methods systematically.\n\nSolution Approach:\n\nBenchmark Suite Development: I plan to develop a benchmark suite targeting the EoM generation methods. This suite will aid in identifying performance bottlenecks by integrating with profiling tools like cProfile. It will also help guide users in selecting the most suitable EoM generation method for their applications.\nRecursive Newton-Euler Algorithm Implementation: Recognizing the unique advantages of the Recursive Newton-Euler Method, especially for systems with a tree-like structure such as robotic manipulators, I aim to develop and integrate this method into SymPy.

          "description": "Accounting for spectral effects in photovoltaic (PV) performance models is critical for accurate and reliable performance forecasts. Variation in the solar spectral distribution changes the useful fraction of irradiance incident on a PV device, and thus can increase or decrease its performance. The relationship between the performance of a PV module and the solar spectrum is captured by a “spectral correction function” (SCF), a plethora of which have been published in the literature over the last quarter of a century. However, only a fraction of these published models are available in pvlib. The aim of this project is to implement new SCFs in pvlib and develop examples to guide users in applying these models. The implementation of these new models will strengthen pvlib through enhancing its flexibility, accuracy, and reliability for different modelling scenarios. Furthermore, the additions to the example gallery will increase the accessibility and usability of these models and pvlib as a whole, in particular for new users.",

With the ever-increasing data, the applications of time series classification are also increasing. Hence, we need classification algorithms that are both efficient and scalable. The Proximity Forest Algorithm is the current state-of-the-art distance-based classifier that creates an ensemble of decision trees, where the splits are based on the similarity between time series measured using various parameterised distance measures. \nCurrently, a version of Proximity Forest which can match the performance of the original implementation has not been implemented in Python. This project aims to implement Proximity Forest in aeon for the classification of univariate time series datasets of equal length and make it accessible for a greater variety of users. The implementation will be benchmarked on the UCR archive to match the results of the original Java implementation in terms of run time and accuracy.",

Plans and brainstorming for refactoring this have been around for a while. \n\nWork done so far on ArviZ-Plots has included a new class, PlotCollection, an improved backend interface and backend system, and 4 “batteries-included” plots at least partially adapted for this new backend. For users, this aims to provide improved visual aesthetics, an abstraction of aesthetics mapping to subplots and a more compact, flexible API overall. For developers, easier writing of new plotting functionality, extensibility and maintainability are the goals. \n\nFor my role in the course of this project, I will be using the PlotCollection class to implement some other plots from old ArviZ and add modular backend functions and visual elements (an intermediate layer for atomic visual elements used across plot types) required for these as appropriate. I will also be working on creating documentation and tests for these new plots added to ArviZ-plots as well as the PlotCollection class used to do these.",

The key outcomes of this project include generalizing Bambi's parsers, integrating PyMC for interoperability, establishing a common infrastructure for future PPLs, extending the `predictive_explorer` function to handle multiple inputs and outputs from various PPLs for comprehensive prior predictive distribution plotting, enhancing the `ppa` function to support models from PreliZ, PyMC, or Bambi for interactive prior updates, and improving the handling of PyMC models within PreliZ's `ppe` function while extending support to PreliZ and Bambi models.",

          "description": "This proposal bridges the gap between audio processing and machine learning by introducing an automatic differentiation (AD) library for the Faust programming language. This library empowers audio engineers to leverage machine learning within their familiar Faust environment.\n\nThe core of the library will be pre-defined building blocks. These include Faust primitives with built-in derivative functions for common math and audio processing tasks. Additionally, there will be helper functions to simplify program construction and various loss functions specifically suited for audio processing. The proposal also explores Faust Neural Net Blocks (FNNBs), which are pre-written code modules representing specific neural network functionalities. These FNNBs will save development time, improve code maintainability, and allow audio engineers to focus on network architecture rather than low-level programming for each layer.\n\nThe project deliverables will showcase the utility of the AD library in various phases. Phase I will deliver a working example of a differentiable filter or envelope in Faust. Phase II will focus on implementing a full-scale machine learning algorithm. This will be achieved through an autodiff file and a weights file. Finally, Phase III and IV will deliver an autoencoder implemented using FNNBs. \n\nBy combining the AD library, FNNBs, and an architecture file specifying the training process, users can design and train complex neural network models for audio processing tasks entirely within Faust. This eliminates the need to switch between Faust and separate machine learning frameworks, while offering the benefits of automatic differentiation for efficient model training.",

          "description": "The DaCe framework uses the Stateful DataFlow multiGraph (SDFG) data-centric intermediate representation. This graph maps to a variety of high-performance architectues and performance engineers can manipulate this graph for achieving state-of-the-art representations. When dealing with large projects with hundreds of thousands lines of codes the state graph can become extremely unreadable due multiple nested cycles, function’s calls, and conditional branching: it becomes nearly impossible to understand smaller parts of the graph and it also makes relating it to the original source code very hard. \n\nTo mitigate this problem the concept of ControlFlowRegion was introduced. A ControlFlowRegion is a region of the SDFG which represents a control flow construct just like a traditional programming language. An example can be the LoopRegion, developed on a separate feature branch (loop_architecture_pt_3), which represents the classic C-like for loop for ( init-clause ; cond-expression ; iteration-expression ). \n\n\nThe project goal is to \n- Implement all the other control flow constructs like if … elif … else and match\n- Implement regions for function calls and with statements\n- Implement user defined regions\n- Add support for all these new regions in the DaCe VSCode extension",

          "description": "The annotation of research data is essential to ensure its findability and reusability. High-quality data annotations require domain expertise, so that annotations are relevant, but also specific technical skills, such as knowing how to handle JSON/XML files. Additionally, people are often reluctant to change their workflows, and the technical affordances in the case of data annotation intensify this challenge. As a result, researchers tend to stick to their “data handling traditions” as soon as data operations become too complex. Unfortunately, this often means that even though projects like Neurobagel are working hard to make life easier for researchers, these tools are not widely adopted. \n\nMy idea for contributing to the Neurobagel project is to combine a user-friendly interface with a Large Language Model (LLM) approach to make the annotation of tabular data even more effortless for researchers. For the end user, the process should be to provide a tabular file and get a first-pass annotation for review without any intermediate steps. From a technical perspective, this should be accomplished by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to categorize columns, such as participant ID or age. To improve the predictions of the LLM, already annotated data will be linked to explicit knowledge from existing ontologies such as SNOMED CT or the Cognitive Atlas and used to provide context for the LLM.",

Current Infant Visual Function Measurement Systems built in previous GSOC 22 and GSOC 23 are efficient and robust solutions but are limited by difficulties with infant cooperation and shortcomings in eye-tracking technology. To address this, a comprehensive upgrade is proposed. A user-friendly and visually engaging interface will be built for researchers and clinicians. Additionally, a wider variety of captivating stimuli, both visual and auditory, will be incorporated to keep infants engaged during testing. The core functionality, eye-tracking, will be significantly improved by exploring advanced deep learning techniques. This will enable precise gaze estimation in all directions, including up and down, providing a more complete picture of an infant's visual attention. Furthermore, a novel test will be developed to identify potential vision issues associated with anisometropic amblyopia. Finally, the system will be designed for seamless integration with various external eye-tracking hardware devices, increasing its flexibility and applicability.

Being able to interact with a model, significantly boosts the understanding of its structure and dynamics. Furthermore, the additional information that will be added can make this viewer an invaluable tool both for an experienced scientist and a beginner in the field, as long as they have some knowledge of python, by providing the capability of exploring new models in a fast, efficient and intuitive manner.

Firstly, user gestures are detected using landmarks generated by MediaPipe by Google. Secondly, these landmarks are used to recognize the gesture performed by the user, and generate Open Sound Control (OSC) signals. Finally, the OSC signals are converted into music using Max/MSP. In addition, new gestures can be dynamically added to the framework, with just a few examples, and mapped to new sounds.\nDeliverables:\n- Experiment to estimate the appropriate delay between a gesture and the resulting sound/effect.\n- Framework based on LivePose or Pose2Art using only the gestures predifined in MediaPipe, able to interface the chosen camera and the sound-card\n- Model based on MediaPipe holistic model to classifiy dynamic gestures\n- Famework to map gestures to sounds through OSC signals.\n- Few-Shot Learning-based model to dynamically add new gestures",

TVB simulator, written in Python, enables the systematic, model-based inference of neurophysiological mechanisms on different brain scales that underlie the generation of macroscopic, commonly used neuroimaging signals (EEG, MEG, fMRI). In the tvb-ecosystem, there is a new repository called tvb-widgets, which consists of UI widgets for Jupyter notebooks. Offering TVB-web interface's functionality as a JupyterLab widget will enhance integration, workflow efficiency, and interactivity making it a valuable addition to the TVB ecosystem for research and educational purposes. The project focuses on enhancing the tvb-widgets repository and developing new widgets. The proposal is for the implementation of more features from the Connectivity cockpit of TVB's web interface as interactive widgets primarily the Space-time Visualizer widget and the Connectivity Matrix Editor widget. This can be achieved by leveraging different libraries like Ipywidgets, PythreeJs, etc. Essential deliverables include classes, functions, tests, etc., for these widgets.",

          "description": "With the advent of machine learning, statistical learning and modelling becoming more prevalent in today’s world, we can estimate values for an unknown data given a trained model i.e. finding value of data(D) given parameter (Θ) .Now what about the reverse? What if we want to find optimal parameter value, given a particular set of dataset. Why is this even required? The very simple answer to this can be found in every modelling and computation textbook. We cannot necessarily measure the other parameters. Let us take an example:\n There are several parameters while defining a neuron whose measurement is difficult to make, for example the axial resistance, the capacitance of the soma etc. Thus to achieve this process we make use of 2 tools, the first is the neuron library which is used for designing your neuron model and setting your parameters ,secondly is a statistical measurement tool used for the parameter estimation .This is done by checking for the voltage value generated by the neuron model and what might the parameter values be for that particular value.\nThe reason to utilize Bayesian inference for parameter estimation is due to the specification of the prior data ,which will help us to increase the accuracy of our model which predicts approximate parameter values. Now the user could specify the prior data on the basis of any previous study or research material.\nNeuroptimus is an open source tool created for the same purpose. It is an interactive tool where the user can drop a dataset file. Train it and use it for parameter estimation .\nI have been tasked to utilize the prior ,the noise (for the calculation of likelihood),and the evidence to find the posterior distribution of the parameter I want to estimate. This is the main gist of the project, but there are various hurdles such as what if it is difficult to find the likelihood ,type of noise, computational costs for multiple parameters etc. These are some other things I believe I will be working on.",

The Allen Institute provides a powerful API that allows users to programmatically access and retrieve data. First through data cleaning, and then through data crawling to obtain data that is difficult to access in the API. In addition, domain-specific language models will be fine-tuned or trained using Google's Gemini model for subsequent data acquisition.\nParameter Conversion: Develop tools(scripts) or design large language model prompts to automatically convert extracted data into a parameter format understood by the NetPyNE, such as .hoc or .swc format. Identify how to set reasonable default values for missing data.\nModel construction: Use the converted parameters to construct neural network models of relevant brain regions in NetPyNE. This includes defining neuron types, neuron connectivity, and synaptic interactions between neurons.\nRun Simulation: Run a simulation of the model in NetPyNE to simulate the brain's response to a specific input stimulus.\nCompare Results: Compare the simulation results with actual biological experimental data to verify the accuracy of the model.\n\nIntended set of deliverables:\nAutomated Data Collection Tool.\nParameter Conversion Script.\nSimulation Run Framework.\nResult Validation Report.\nDocumentation and User Guide.",

It has also become apparent that the automated tests need to be more stable, as the 4diac IDE is constantly being extended and improved and some tests that ran last year are no longer running due to these changes.\nTherefore, these tests need to be more stable and also easily adaptable. \n\nAn important step in this regard will be that the tests will no longer rely on hard-coded coordinates, but will be able to search for elements by ID.

          "description": "The proposal aims to enhance Eclipse Winery, a web-based environment for modeling OASIS TOSCA topologies, by implementing basic security measures. Currently, Winery focuses on providing a graphical editing environment for modeling application topologies. However, the proposal suggests adding a Language Server Protocol (LSP) provider for OASIS TOSCA YAML files. This would allow Winery to support the latest version of the OASIS TOSCA standard and handle dynamic type additions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project include:\n\n1-Developing an LSP server that supports the latest OASIS TOSCA 2.0 standard.\n\n2-Ensuring that the LSP server is aware of newly introduced types and makes them available in the service template.\n\n3-Enabling the LSP server to handle multiple files.\n\n4-Demonstrating the functionality of the LSP server using compatible IDEs such as Eclipse Theia, Visual Studio Code, or Eclipse IDE.\n\n5-Writing clean and maintainable code, with a preference for using modern Java (version 21 or later).\n\n\nThe proposal indicates that the project's size is estimated at 350 hours and rates its difficulty as medium.\n\nOverall, the proposal aims to improve the security and functionality of Eclipse Winery by implementing an LSP server for OASIS TOSCA YAML files, thereby providing a more robust and comprehensive modeling environment.",

          "description": "The 4diac IDE is an extensible, IEC 61499 compliant engineering environment for distributed control applications. The current state of its graphical editors presents challenges, as they timely result in poor user experience and frequent errors. To overcome these issues, there is a strong need to introduce an automated test suite specifically for the graphical editors. These test suites will detect errors that will enhance the overall reliability of the editors. Through automated testing, we can effectively implement error indicators within graphical models, ensuring timely identification and resolution of issues. With that, these test suites will provide support to features characterized by deep hierarchical nesting, which directly complicates interaction within the graphical editors. By systematically addressing these challenges, we aim to significantly improve the usability and reliability of the graphical editors within the 4diac IDE.",

          "description": "The project consists of replacing the I/O Layer of pgagroal, today highly dependent on the libev library, for a pgagroal's own implementation. The so called I/O Layer is an event loop abstracted by libev. \n\nThe motivation behind this project is the fact that libev is no longer being maintained. Therefore pgagroal needs an efficient (i.e. maintainable, reliable, fast, lightweight, secure, and scalable) implementation of an event loop that can be maintained by the pgagroal community.\n\nCurrently, pgagroal depends on libev to (a) watch for incoming read/write requests from its connections in a non-blocking fashion; (b) launch timer events; and (c) watch signals.\n\nIn Linux, these functionalities may be optimally achieved by using io_uring (introduced in Linux kernel 5.1). io_uring is a communication channel between a system's application and the kernel by providing an interface to receive notifications when I/O is possible on file descriptors. io_uring is accessible to system applications through liburing, which is a library that contains helpers for the setup of io_uring. A successful Linux implementation of an efficient event loop for pgagroal necessarily utilizes io_uring -- as well as other Linux I/O interfaces (e.g. stdio) -- for efficient I/O.\n\nIn FreeBSD, these functionalities may be optimally achieved by using kqueue (introduced in FreeBSD 4.1). kqueue is an event notification interface that allows monitoring of multiple file descriptors. Like io_uring in Linux, kqueue enables non-blocking I/O operations, but it is specifically designed to fit into the FreeBSD kernel's event-driven architecture.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to provide a plan to achieve such efficient implementations in both Linux and FreeBSD, which shall be, at the end of this program, at least as efficient as libev, but fully maintained and controlled by the pgagroal community.",

          "description": "The enviroCar Android app provides capabilities for visualizing user related tracks within a map. For this feature, the app makes use of several libraries of the Mapbox mapping framework. However, recent changes in the terms-of-use of Mapbox as well as their switch to a non open-source license makes it problematic to continue relying on Mapbox.\r\n\r\nMapLibre Native library for Android is an open-source alternative to Mapbox mapping\r\nframework. Migrating to MapLibre will ensure the project’s adherence to open-source principles & long-term sustainability.\r\n\r\nMapbox's current issues are preventing many developers in the open-source community from participating in the further development of the enviroCar app. Thus, this project aims to reimplement mapping functionality utilizing the MapLibre Native library for Android, by refactoring all the views in the enviroCar app that show a map.",

          "description": "OGC SensorThings API is an international standard to eliminate vendor lock-ins in IoT systems and to create an open geospatial ecosystem by defining a standard data model and describe how to retrieve the ingested data. However, the standard by itself does not specify a way to physically store the data. Most of the current server implementations are all based on Postgres datastores using the PostGIS extension. Unfortunately, relational databases are not a great choice to store large volumes of data, which is often the case with IoT applications. As a result, retrieving large volumes of data from any of the open source SensorThings API servers is painfully slow.\n\nCloud-native geospatial file formats offer a scalable, flexible, cost-effective\nand a much faster way to store and work with large scale geospatial data on the web. GeoParquet is an encoding, based on a columnar data storage format for tabular data that significantly compresses the data and improves querying efficiency\n\nA cloud native SensorThings API extension using GeoParquet could significantly enhance the standard's ability to ingest and aggregate large heterogeneous streams of sensor data. The proposal hence puts forth a design architecture for any SensorThings API server to use GeoParquet to store and retrieve sensor data in a more efficient manner reducing memory overhead and network latencies when retrieving such data over the web.",

As map data (e.g. OSM data, Wikipedia descriptions) is updated, new MWM files are created and downloaded by clients.\n\nMap file size has a direct impact on user experience: larger files take more time and money to download and update. The median MWM file is around 50MB, many are more than 100MB, and some are more than 300MB in size.\n\nAddressing this size discrepancy requires understanding the root cause of the bloat.\nIs it descriptions that are not being correctly simplified? Elevation data that is not optimized? Unreasonable area sizes for individual files?\nBy improving existing tools for map analysis, further analyzing the differences, and changing the construction and design of map files we can reduce file sizes and improve the user's experience of Organic Maps.",

          "description": "When planning a trip, for any mode of transportation, one may want to opt for an alternative route, like one with fewer turns, or less traffic lights, or even less elevation gain (not everyone is a professional hiker!). At the moment, OrganicMaps has a very rudimentary system for one particular case -- avoiding toll roads -- which is insufficient.\n\nTo solve this, I propose implementing a proper alternative route system, with many selection criterion. While in the planning view, the app should display alternative routes based on the most likely wanted criterion for the selected mode of transportation and area (no need to suggest routes with less traffic lights when hiking in a mountain, for example). The system should also be fairly easy to extend with more options in the future.\n\nWork should start with a deep dive into OrganicMaps' codebase, to understand the modified A* algorithm already in use. Then, there should be a period of research, to understand which algorithms, data structures and methods are the most adequate for implementing the alternative route system. After that, there should be a planning phase, where the final algorithm will be devised. With that done, coding can start. After a period of testing, debugging and inevitable bug fixing, there should be a short period to finish the documentation (which ideally should happen naturally as code is written).\n\nDeliverables:\n* An algorithm (ideally based on the existing one) capable of computing alternative routes for a given trip, within the desired memory and CPU constraints.\n* A set of default criteria, each associated with one or more modes of transportation, with which to run the modified algorithm.\n* [optional] Thorough documentation of the underlying algorithm, to complement the in-code documentation.\n* [optional] UI/UX for route selection -- a user must be able to pick an alternative route when planning.",

          "description": "My interest in AsyncAPI was sparked by my admiration for the technical ingenuity behind Netflix's ability to provide flawless video streaming services globally. As a Master's student studying Data Science and Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I am eager to explore the intricacies of event-driven architectures further, particularly by deepening my contributions to the AsyncAPI community. \n\nMy ambition is to transition from a role of simply contributing code to assuming the responsibilities of a project maintainer for the AsyncAPI Generator, a key instrument for facilitating documentation and code generation based on the AsyncAPI specification. This commitment aims to not just contribute technically but also to foster community engagement and ensure the longevity of the project. In this new role as a maintainer, I plan to review and improve documentation, handle incoming requests, engage in community discourse, assist new contributors, and spearhead the implementation of innovative features, complete with testing. Additionally, I will document my path to becoming a maintainer, the challenges faced, and the insights gained, culminating in a roadmap for future maintainers. This endeavor is not only a testament to my commitment to enhancing the AsyncAPI project but also an opportunity to contribute to the sustainability and enrichment of the broader open-source community. Leveraging my technical skills, demonstrated in a recent project that achieved a 20% performance increase using React.js and Redux, and my proactive participation in AsyncAPI discussions and enhancements, I am prepared to undertake this significant shift.",

However, IHR currently computes a new database of this form each week, and this deployment is not automated, which increases the time it takes to make the new data publicly available. Thus, the goal of this project is to design and implement an automated pipeline to deploy a new database to a remote server each week and to upload the database dump to a public repository. The solution must be maintainable and rigorously tested, with unit tests for each IYP dataset. This ensures that users receive reliable data with no downtime and that future developers can easily expand upon the pipeline.\n\nThese goals will be accomplished by completing the following four subparts: creating unit tests, creating a pipeline to automatically compute a database dump and push it to Github, integrating the tests into this pipeline, and extending the pipeline to also deploy a running instance of the database to a remote server.",

This feature will be particularly advantageous during peak usage periods or when prioritizing specific tasks.\nFurthermore, we address the challenge of distributed rendering of single images by adopting a sample-based rendering approach. This method ensures more efficient utilization of computational resources across nodes, minimizing memory usage and avoiding artifacts caused by boundary dependencies.",

          "description": "In recent years, Blender support for macOS specific features has drastically improved. With the introduction of the Metal Viewport, features such as HDR support and development support from Apple, Blender can now be easily regarded as one of the best 3D applications available for the Mac. However, when it comes to its user interface, Blender still doesn’t feel quite properly integrated within the macOS environment. This GSoC proposal aims to change this, with the goal of making Blender feel closer to a fully native macOS application.\n\nThis proposal plans to improve the Blender macOS user experience by incorporating part of the Blender interface into the macOS interface. Effectively making it closer to the macOS Human Interface Guidelines, and providing macOS Blender users with a familiar experience, more tightly integrated into their operating system.\n\nTo achieve this goal, this proposal will focus on the improvements of two main UI elements: the macOS menu bar and title bar. While this proposal will focus on macOS implementation, a byproduct of it will be the creation of an unified interface for native menu bar items, which will then make it possible to implement such functionality on other OS and Desktop Environments in the future.",

          "description": "Unikraft is a unikernel capable to boot in various environments and through quite a few boot protocols. From supporting the first version of Multiboot, being able to boot through the Linux Boot Protocol on ARM64 and having its own UEFI stub enabling the Operating System to load without a Bootloader, Unikraft has still a lot to learn with respect to the booting environments it knows.\n\nOne such booting protocol that would be very useful is Multiboot2. This protocol represents a significant improvement over Multiboot version 1, providing improved flexibility in the realm of bootloaders. A notable improvement is the extended information provided by Multiboot2, which provides detailed and accurate communication between the bootloader and the operating system kernel during the bootstrapping process. In addition, Multiboot2 comes with a standardized tag system, enabling easier data and system configuration parsing between the bootloader and the kernel and allowing greater interoperability and better integration of boot modules. The introduction of optional commandline further enhances the flexibility of the boot process. Together, these enhancements contribute to a more robust and scalable bootstrapping mechanism, making Multiboot2 a better choice than Multiboot version 1.\n\nConcretely speaking, it would allow us to boot directly in 64-bit mode, while having access to pointers to the UEFI tables as well as the ACPI tables, unlike Multiboot 1, offering us access to more modern firmware interfaces. The task at hand involves integrating the Multiboot2 definitions as well as its corresponding bootstrapping code into Unikraft. Auxiliary scripts may be implemented to allow the automatic creation of Multiboot2-based Unikraft bootable images.",

The main reason this does not happen is because the Unikraft bootable images are missing the Linux header.\n\nThe first step will be reading documentation and familiarizing myself with the project. I would estimate that this step will take about two weeks. The Linux x86 Boot Protocol will be studied and questions will be asked towards the community and the mentor. \n\nSecondly, a step for planning ahead the workflow that will dictate the way I will work on the project (two weeks). By doing this, a schedule will be set in place that will help me always be on time. Design the structure of the external program to parse bootloader metadata and generate the Linux Boot Protocol header. Comparing the x86 header to the ARM64 one could highlight  certain common traits that can be used to minimize the existent code.\n\nFinally, the coding period will start that will be summed up by taking feedback, discussing unforeseen problems, striving to meet deadlines. This will take approximately twelve weeks. At this time, the best course of action is to respect the planning done before and focus on integrating everything that can be picked from the UEFI script.

          "description": "Detecting errors without running all possible program executions can be an exhaustive task. Automated formal methods, such as SMT-based model-checking and automatic program repair tools, play a crucial role in finding and fixing critical errors. The generation and categorization of inputs that lead to the same error can help detect the buggy parts of a program and suggest possible fixes. This can be achieved by constructing the set of paths between the initial abstract state and the abstract error in the ARG and checking the feasibility (satisfiability of SMT query) of formulas over the transitions of these paths. CPAchecker adopts a variety of configurable model-checking and automatic program repair approaches for finding counterexamples with error descriptions. One of these approaches is the CEGAR-based predicate abstraction model, which iteratively refines the abstracted model using information obtained from counterexamples. In this work, I aim to find a predicate that describes all possible inputs to the program leading to a violation. For instance, if numerical input of even values triggers the program bug, then we want to return the predicate \"x%2 = 0\" rather than \"(x = 0 ∨ x = 2 ∨ x = 4 ...).\" I will be learning existing algorithms of CPAchecker and developing new approaches for suggesting various typed predicates by either following a CPA graph-based approach for merging failing states in one path in ARG or a CEGAR-based approach for iteratively refining the predicates to fail the put assertions in the program.",

The framework enables hardware verification to be solved by various software verifiers in addition to hardware verifiers. It is widely recognized that different verifiers possess complementary strengths across various classes of instances. Therefore, to fully leverage the power of hardware and software verification techniques, I propose to develop an adaptive algorithm selection framework Btor2-Select for the Btor2 verification tasks. The framework applies deep reinforcement learning to adaptively select verifiers from a suite of both software and hardware verification tools, aiming to solve the given instance the most efficiently. The adaptive algorithm selector leverages a blend of offline instance-representation data and online tool-solving data to refine the algorithm selection continuously. Specifically, the Bag of Subgraphs (BoS) model is used to encode the input instance and the parametrized deep Q-network (P-DQN) is proposed as the learning algorithm for the problem.",

Project DAVE operates within this context, offering a simulation platform that leverages ROS and Gazebo infrastructure and is tailored for the rapid testing and evaluation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs/UUVs). With that in mind, the Physics-based Sonar Simulation for Underwater Robotics project is dedicated to enhancing and transitioning physics-based sonar simulation plugin to ROS 2 and the most recent LTS version of Gazebo (e.g. Harmonic).\n\nIn order to complete this project, I will first follow the migration guides from the ROS1\nto ROS 2 environment, making the necessary changes to the files of the multi-beam sonar plugin. If necessary, ROS 1 bridge package could be used to keep the system running while not everything has been transitioned to ROS 2 yet. Then the same should be done for the Gazebo version, using, for example, the available migration tutorials for modifying worlds, plugins, SDF files and so on. During the transitioning process, I must develop demonstrations and examples of how the new version of the plugin works.\n \nOnce the migration is complete, we can move on to the next step of implementation\nof half-precision calculations in CUDA in order to improve refresh rates. Currently, the\nplugin’s CUDA codes use single precision, so at this stage it would be necessary to modify in the scripts the declaration of variables/parameters and adapt the current functions to support half-precision format. \nAdditionally,  algorithm performance tests should be done to evaluate whether the changes to half-precision are functional.\n \nThroughout the process, I intend to document everything that was developed, the errors and\nsolutions found in order to offer support for future developers and users of the plugin.",

          "description": "The goal of this project is to develop a 3D scene capturing pipeline within OpenCV by using SLAM and Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, the project will include data processing, training, evaluation and visualization stages accompanied with documentation of how to use each part. \nOverall, the project consists of 3 main tasks: Tracking, Mapping and Visualization.\nIn the tracking phase, Droid-SLAM will be used to generate a dense representation of the underlying scene. To ease the implementation in later phases, a unified I/O scheme for various datasets and projects will be set up. Additionally, COLMAP will be used to compare SfM and SLAM methods. Further camera calibration will be used to evaluate and increase the accuracy. The second phase uses the generated point cloud as input and optimizes a Gaussian Splatting model. This part will require a standalone implementation of Gaussian Splatting which is based on NeRFstudio's splatfacto model. Using PyTorch, the implementation will include I/O routines, Camera classes, a Gaussian densifcation/pruning class, as well as wrapper classes for the forward/backward passes of the CUDA rasterizer. The most important aspects in this phase lies on the reproducibility of the Gsplat implementation and a comparable performance to the INRIA GS implementation. Additional methods like scene compression and camera pose optimization will be tested. In the last phase, the pipeline will be compared with other methods such as NeRF, SplaTAM or original GS. By computing PSNR, SSIM or MSE on test views, a comparison of the visual quality can be made. To further assess the quality of the pipeline, the deviation from the ground truth camera path will be analyzed. Finally, the entire pipeline will be extensively documented with Doxygen and all steps, including setup and training with own datasets, will be explained. To further assist the user, a short demonstration video on YouTube as well as visualization of the different stages will be provided.",

By developing acquisition and tracking blocks to capture these signals, precise positioning and advanced research on the ionosphere could be enhanced. \n\nAs a user with a year of experience using GNSS-SDR and GNURadio, the process of developing the required solution will be carry out in a better way. The expected time to complete the project is 350h, which can be splitted in these deliverable groups: \n\n1.- 50h: acquiring information about the problem and studying the way acquisition and tracking blocks work in GNSS-SDR. The type of signals, the way to decode messages and their structure, should be well understood before starting coding the solution. The proposed deliverable is a short presentation, in order to show this information to the mentors and after that, proceed with the coding. \n\n2.- 250h: the main block of the project. During this period, the solution has to be created in C++. The different processing blocks (acquisition, tracking, observables and PVT) must work at the end of the period for SBAS signals. The proposed deliverables are tracking and acquisition blocks working after the first 150h, and then the integration with the observables and PVT has to be demonstrated. \n\n3.- To conclude, the last 50h of project are dedicated to develop tests to demonstrate the robustness of the solution and to implement the code for real-time signals.",

Currently, cBioPortal lacks support for visualizing single-cell data alongside bulk genomics data, hindering researchers from gaining a comprehensive understanding of cancer biology. To address this, I propose the development of a dedicated single-cell analysis module within cBioPortal, focusing on the MSK Spectrum dataset.\n\nThe key problem I am addressing is the inability to integrate single-cell gene expression data with existing cancer genomics workflows. By incorporating single-cell data into cBioPortal, researchers will be empowered to identify specific cells with altered gene expression, understand their contribution to overall expression patterns, and connect this information with genetic alterations.\n\nMy solution involves developing a custom Single-Cell Tab within cBioPortal's study view.

I will utilize existing charting libraries like CanvasJS and React primitives for visualization components, ensuring seamless integration with cBioPortal's design language.\n\nMy deliverables include:\n\nCustom Single-Cell Tab within cBioPortal study view.\nDataset information panel for study description and cell type/sample details.\nGene selection panel with autocomplete functionality.\nInteractive visualizations including boxplots, scatter plots, stacked bar graphs, and pie charts.\nFiltering options for focused data exploration.\nDownload options for data and plots in common file formats.",

          "description": "The cBioPortal organization is dedicated to assisting clinicians and researchers in the analysis of complex cancer genomics data. And cBioPortal includes OncoKB annotation in it's view to provide detailed biological effect and clinical implications for each variant. Despite the availability of a standard API for annotating alterations, users without a computational background still find it challenging to annotate their variants. This project addresses this gap by first developing a pipeline to fetch a list of genomic variants from the MSK-IMPACT clinical cohort that have not been curated by OncoKB. The approach utilizes distributed parallel computing to accelerate the identification of target variants while ensuring data consistency through regular monitoring and timely updates. Then, a web interface has been designed to allow users to view and annotate these uncurated variants directly from the webpage. This interface supports searching and sorting functionalities, enabling users to find specific variants and prioritize them for OncoKB curation. The outcome of this initiative includes an automated pipeline, powered by AirFlow, for the continuous retrieval and verification of uncurated variants, alongside a user-friendly interface that facilitates the direct annotation of variants by users through webpage interactions. This project aims to simplify the variant annotation process, making it more accessible to a broader audience and further advancing the field of precision oncology.",

Currently, there's no clear way to do this, leading to inconsistent accessibility practices.\n\nMy solution involves five main parts that are also my deliverables:\n\n(1). StreamField Block for Images: I will create a new block specifically for images that includes an alt text field. This ensures editors don't forget to add alt text.\n(2). Modifying the Image Model: I will add an \"image description\" field to the existing image model. This provides more flexibility for alt text.\n(3). Writing tests.\n(4). Updating documentation.\n(5). Exploring the use of AI to generate alt text suggestions (as a stretch goal, along with some other stretch goals in the PDF I attached).\n\nI plan to achieve the first two goals by building upon the pertinent Pull Requests I have already drafted at the time of writing this. Goals 3 and 4 will follow each of the first two goals closely, and I have commenced research on integrating AI models with inspiration from the Wagtail-AI GitHub repository. For goal 5, I plan on working hand in hand with the A11y team.\n\nThis project will make Wagtail sites more accessible for visually impaired users and improve overall accessibility compliance.",

It has a set of tools for documentation, code and model generation, event management, etc. which helps to easily build and maintain EDA. The AsyncAPI Website is the primary source of information for users and developers. \n\nCurrently, the website lacks visual consistency, repeated elements lack consistency in design, and duplicate styling is used for similar visual styles. This makes the codebase and design non-modular.  Existing UI patterns are undocumented which results in miscommunication and re-inventing the wheel instead of building new features.\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive UI Kit that can enhance the existing design, and streamline the development process to simplify the creation and management of cohesive elements in the website. This website UI Kit will help in preventing the process of rebuilding similar components.",

          "description": "Since CVA6/Ariane is highly modular by design, it is relatively easy to develop and integrate multiple L1 caches. Additionally, because CVA6/Ariane is open source, users can develop L1 caches customized for their needs.\n\nThe primary technological feature of HPDC is its L1 Dcache, which supports Multi-Requester, Multi-Issue, and Out-of-Order operations. This capability is especially valuable for HPC systems striving for high memory throughput. However, HPDC is still under development, and various functional enhancements are being implemented or planned to make it more useful for HPC systems by providing a variety of functions for diverse cores.\n\nIn this year's GSoC, the objective is to first expand the functionality of the L1 cache for the CVA6/Ariane core, and then to make it scalable to accommodate many cores, laying the groundwork for making HPDC an even more significant entity for HPC systems.\n\nBy exploring the appropriate scale and structure, it's possible to enhance HPDC's functions to be used as an instruction cache with scalability in mind. Furthermore, by connecting with OpenPiton, it becomes extremely easy to scale to large systems with many cores. This aligns with the goals of the GSoC project.",

          "description": "TinyParrot is a BlackParrot RISC-V multi-core variant that aims to be small enough to fit onto educational FPGA development boards like the Pynq Z2. In order to get there, the TinyParrot variant needs to optimize and constrain itself in order to meet the physical device constraints (such as LUTs, BRAMs, and flip-flops) provided by development boards like the Pynq Z2 FPGA development board. This project will implement size optimizations that ultimately decrease the amount of resources required by TinyParrot, enabling TinyParrot to fit on the Pynq Z2. \n\n\nAt a high level, this will be accomplished by first parameterizing the FMUL/FDIV instructions as part of an MFD parameterization effort. Then, hardware primitives will be re-mapping using the BaseJump STL library in order to standardize and optimize the existing RTL. The ultimate goal of these optimization efforts is to implement TinyParrot on the Pynq Z2.",

          "description": "This project concerns the benchmarking of the OpenRISC project's mor1kx and marocchino cores, and improving the latter by attempting to resolve a previously discovered issue with memory access speed. This and other potential improvements may be aided by discoveries during the benchmarking segment.\n\nThe proposed project consists of three major components: learning / research, benchmarking, and core improvements. This proposal identifies extensions to the latter two depending on time and feasibility. The first segment involves familiarisation with the tools used and the Embench benchmark suite, investigation of other benchmarks, and the development / documentation of a test methodology. Other benchmarks (including potential modifications of prior ones) may be added to the project scope as a part of developing the methodology. Documentation on the toolchain setup process and benchmarking methodology will be delivered at the end of this segment. The second segment involves running the benchmarks according to the methodology and analysing their results. The methodology will be fully documented to allow results to be reproduced, and to provide a basis for the introduction of other benchmarks to build upon. Test scripts, data produced, and further documentation of methodology will be delivered at the end of this segment. The final segment involves improving the marocchino core's memory access subsystem, and potentially making other improvements based on the benchmarking results, which will be delivered as modifications to its Verilog source. Depending on time, the benchmarking or core improvement parts may be taken further, but the base requirements for both will be met.",

Silicon Compiler is an open-source, modular build system that automates the translation process from hardware design source code to silicon.

By leveraging the Silicon Compiler's microservices and developing a JavaScript API, users will be able to run various hardware design tasks, such as logic synthesis, place-and-route, static timing analysis, and simulation, directly from within their familiar coding environments. This integration will streamline the design process, improve productivity, and provide a seamless experience for developers working with Verilog or related hardware description languages (HDLs) within the editor.

          "description": "The semiconductor industry, driven by Moore's Law, continuously pushes the boundaries of integrated circuit (IC) technology, leading to ever-shrinking transistor feature sizes. Recent research by the U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. DOE) shows promising endeavors of reducing feature sizes to record sizes as small as 1 nanometer. However, the growing complexity of ICs raises the likelihood of manufacturing defects, consequently, sustaining reliability within this zero-failure tolerance domain poses an increasingly daunting task. In this landscape, Design-for-Testability (DFT) features play a paramount role in guaranteeing the quality and reliability of integrated circuits (ICs) amidst evolving complexities. \n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the Fault DFT toolchain through the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program. “Fault” is a premier open-source DFT toolchain that provides a comprehensive solution including automatic test pattern generation (ATPG), scan insertion, and scan chain testing. The project focuses on improving Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) fault coverage within the Fault framework by integrating algorithmic ATPG methodologies and implementing techniques for enhancing controllability and observability in digital designs. By addressing these challenges, the project seeks to advance open-source EDA tools and meet the evolving demands of the semiconductor industry.",

          "description": "Sometimes, in the context of quantum chemistry, the quantum state of a system in a crystal or molecule can be well described only by its occupation and/or spin operators. The goal of Model Hamiltonians, one of the APIs of the QC-Devs, is to create a framework for constructing the models and outputting them into a format that is possible for traditional Python packages solving Quantum Many-Body problems. \n\n\nIn some cases, it is more convenient to think only about the occupation number of an atomic (or functional moiety), which constitutes an occupation-based Hamiltonian. The most general occupation-number Hamiltonian we consider is the generalized Pariser-Parr-Pople + pairing (PPP+P) Hamiltonian. For some other phenomena, it’s convenient to write the Hamiltonian only in function of the spin operators. This constitutes the Spin-based Hamiltonians and can be exemplified by the Heisenberg model.\n\nOn the other hand, for some materials like superconductors, it’s necessary to combine both types of models at the same time, in a class known as occupation-and-spin-based Hamiltonians, where the most known is the t-J-U-V model, which can be expressed as a sum of the Heisenberg XXZ and the PPP hamiltonian.\n\n\nThe package already includes implemented occupation-based and spin-based Hamiltonians. However, there is still a need for additional occupation- and spin-based Hamiltonians.\n\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to implement occupation-and-spin-based Hamiltonians, which involves the following steps:\n\n\n1. Establish a dictionary-based database to include standard constants defining various atoms and their connectivity types.\n2. Develop an API that integrates the existing code with the occupation- and spin-based Hamiltonians.\n3. Design and execute tests for the implemented API to ensure its reliability and functionality.\n4.

          "description": "We have an online IDE that we currently embed into our problem pages. However, the IDE is currently embedded but not fully integrated, the reason being that it is not written in Vue.js + typescript as the rest of the web platform. As such it's hard to debug, add new features and work around with. We would like to refactor online IDE into a Vue.js component that is fully integrated into the problem pages of omegaup.com.",
