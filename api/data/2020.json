Each version of python may need a pre-built wheel if there is native code. And to add support for python 3.7, 3.8 we have to add wheels in the third party  repo of 4 variants(oses) for each dependency.<br>\nb)We support Windows, Linux, macOS and possibly FreeBSD each with some possible architecture variants.

In order to deal with time intervals of clips/sequences it makes sense to have operators that help with temporal reasoning. Such operators have been given by James F. Allen. The core OTIO API is written in C++. A lot of other higher level languages are popular for tooling. Many such languages (such as Lua, Go, Ruby, etc) are not directly compatible with C++ but have ways to interact with a C-API. So it would help if we have a C wrapper for OTIO. Java is one of the most versatile languages, also powering one of the most pervasive platforms - Android. Mobile Computing is becoming more powerful and widespread by the day. Having Java bindings will help us get OTIO support to all the Java compatible platforms.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>With increasing popularity in CubeSat technologies, it has gotten ever so important to have low-cost systems that complement the economical and self-reliant nature of today’s cubesats providers. One of the most important parts of an end to end small satellite business is ground-based tracking. Satellite tracking provides valuable information on the whereabouts with the use of large antennas and high power transmitters at the price of expense and lead time.</p>\n<p>It is thus important to use an alternative tracking method, for example, Doppler Tracking. Doppler based orbit determination uses a doppler frequency shift to convert to a distance problem. Then, orbits may be directly fitted to the Doppler data in a trial and error fashion, but a much less laborious way of computing is to differentially correct an initial approximation of the orbit. This way the cost of the tracking system is kept low because equipment needs beyond the essential receiver are small, at a minimum consisting of an amplifier and a variable oscillator.</p>\n<p>So through this project, the goal is to determine the orbit of active satellites using Doppler shift by implementing an algorithm and simulate the final results.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The problem of near-Earth environment congestion  has become increasingly important due to the growing number of both active and inactive Resident Space Objects. The U.S. Strategic Command's Joint Space Operations Center processes more that 400.000 measurements daily taken by the Space Surveillance Network that includes a wide range of RF and electro-optical sensors. The catalog information can be augmented by the observations taken not only by high-end designated tracking assets, but also by cost-effective consumer-level sensors. \nWhile lacking high sensitivity, these sensors can still be used to perform uncued Initial Orbit Determination. Recently, in addition to electro-optical sensors, the appearance of low-cost Software-Defined Radios made it possible to deploy low-cost passive radar tracking stations. By using a network of such stations it might render possible to create and maintain an open-source orbiting object catalog. The proposed research is focused on developing software infrastructure to process measurements from multiple ground stations and perform orbit determination from Doppler observations.</p>\n",

However, the current AFL++ does not support grammar and therefore struggles with highly-structured inputs like PHP, JavaScript, or HTML . Although AFL++ allows users to define a dictionary, including language keywords, to help generate inputs, it still lacks more structured descriptions of the underlying syntax.</p>\n<p>To tackle the existing limitations of AFL++, the main goal of this project is to develop a pluggable grammar mutator that is integrated with AFL++’s mutation engine and can efficiently generate grammar-aware inputs. On one hand, like Nautilus, we want to combine grammar mutators with AFL++’s mutation engine. Also, we want to avoid the potential limitation of Nautilus: “over time Nautilus de-generates to structure-unaware greybox fuzzing”, as indicated by AFLSmart paper. On the other hand, we want to generate test cases efficiently as F1 fuzzer. Furthermore, to improve usability, we will develop a program generator that takes the grammar model as input and generates a mutator library, which is based on AFL++’s custom mutator APIs.</p>\n",

Initially, I had envisioned the project with Flutter completely for cross-platform support as it suited the project idea. But along my way, working out the details and developing the sample prototype for the project idea, I got to know that ‘Landmark Detection’ from the Firebase Vision API in particular wasn’t yet supported with Flutter. To make it work, I needed to write quite good amount of native code for both Android and iOS platforms. If we were use to use on-device processing, that would make the app itself heavy since we would need to train our own custom ML model with a lot of data as an user can try to detect a monument from any angle possible. All these points, got me to reject the idea of Flutter for the complete app development. But at the same time, Flutter really has some great benefits such as extremely good UX/UI development, smooth performance, faster productive development, multiplatform support for future using same codebase. So I thought why not develop a native Android application and integrate Flutter with it for the frontend work and some backend work binding as well if needed.</p>\n",

Normal maps are textures that are efficient for introducing spatial variational detail on smooth geometry. Information from the normal map, in current shading point, can be used to define either shading normal of meso-surface or microsurface profile of microfacet bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In this project, we will implement a method from Schüssler et al.  \"Microfacet-based normal mapping for robust Monte Carlo path tracing\" which tackles with microfacet based normal mapping. The result of this method enables us to use arbitrary normal maps and BRDFs for defining the microfacet BRDF for the whole surface. Important properties of the introduced microfacet BRDF are energy conservation, symmetry and discrete distribution of microsurface normals which preserves high-frequency detail.</p>\n",

Two of the high-level BioGears objectives are lowering the barrier to create medical training content and training the military. I believe that a clinically relevant comprehensive model of the naloxone reversal of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression could serve both as a training tool for emergency medical personnel as well as a predictive tool for the dose and frequency of nasally administered naloxone. Current guidelines for nasal naloxone usage are ambiguous and dependent on a wait-and-see approach instead of a high-fidelity data-driven predictive model, which risks under-usage of the life-saving drug due to basic human error.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Elastic deformation is an essential component of animation pipelines. Volumetric soft body simulation can be used to capture the complex details of muscle and skin, e.g. volume preservation under collision/compression. In visual effects, such methods must also be robust to extreme deformation (no numerical blow-ups) and fast enough for interactive manipulation. Moreover, many of the underlying material models are nonlinear and computationally expensive, such as hyper-elastic models for realistic tissue or artistically-defined deformation. Toward these challenges I propose the implementation of a volumetric soft body solver in Blender, that is not only rapid and robust, but is general to hyper-elastic materials. The solver will also be capable of robustly resolving self-collisions and possibly other constraints. This would greatly improve the use of physics in Blender for animation pipelines.</p>\n",

OpenSCAD at its core uses CGAL for geometry evaluation and OpenCSG and OpenGL for rendering. \n    OpenSCAD performs huge computations in the process of creating the required geometries. These geometries are stored in the cache for avoiding repetitive computations.  But this cache data is not persistent and destroys when the application closes. The goal of this project is to create a persistent cache system for OpenSCAD which uses a key-value datastore to store cache.

Besides not being elegant it brings many problems with it, like not being able to save the visualizations inside the notebook for sharing or bringing visual complexity of the entire GUI into the view instead of just displaying the 3D model. It is therefore important to find a way to visualize FreeCAD's 3D scene in the IPython display system as supported by Jupyter Notebook.</p>\n<p>Tackling the open issue “IPython / Jupyter support” I aim to implement a IPython compatible visualization of FreeCAD’s 3D Open Inventor scene graph. To achieve this I intend to choose a suitable JavaScript library able to render a 3D scene graph and to implement a mapping between it and the Open Inventor scene graph. After this as a byproduct I want to implement a better WebGL export based on the scene graph instead of document objects as currently found in FreeCAD. For this I can reuse and integrate the scene graph mapping component. Lastly I want to document the results in the Wiki and create an example Jupyter notebook.</p>\n",

However, newer long-read technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) are becoming more prevalent due to the advantages they offer over short reads. The main advantage of long reads is that they span a much larger portion of the genome or transcriptome, making it easier to detect events such as structural variants or isoforms. As more researchers begin to take advantage of long reads, GenPipes needs to evolve and support long-read technology in its main pipelines.\n    The objective of this project is to create a new RNA-seq pipeline (rnaseq_longreads), that supports long-read inputs. The new pipeline will be created based on the current versions of the RNA-seq pipeline, with the addition of the minimap2 aligner as well as StringTie v2 and Ballgown for generating transcript counts.\n    In addition to implementing a long-read RNA-seq pipeline within the GenPipes framework, short-read RNA-seq pipeline will also be updated to utilize StringTie2 and both pipelines will be tested to ensure that they are working properly.</p>\n",

Its support for diverse programming languages, different access control models and the powerful adapters gains it the greatest popularity in the open source community. However, there are still lots of difficulties in utilizing Casbin at the frontend, especially applying it on the management of users’ accessibility to specific UX widgets. In the GSoC 2020, I wish to implement a friendly JS library (aka Casbin.js)  and other supported facilities to extend Casbin to the frontend development. This project mainly includes a plug-and-play Javascript library that supports for seamless connection with server, auto page controlling and the corresponding components and plugins for modern frontend frameworks.</p>\n",

Exposing the full shared library descriptors to the interpreter at runtime translates into an increased memory footprint. ROOT’s exploratory programming concepts allow implicit and explicit runtime shared library loading. It requires the interpreter to load the library descriptor. Re-parsing of descriptors’ content has a noticeable effect on runtime performance. \nC++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of the C++ Code. C++ Modules have been implemented for Unix and OS X systems already and it is expected that with next release of ROOT, C++ modules will be default on OS X.

Current infrastructure still faces limitations to tackle the expected increase in data in terms of storage capacity and computation time. Early event reconstructions were based on matrix element methods followed by Monte Carlo techniques. Recent advances focused on boosting the speed of event simulations. For instance, C++ - based DELPHES uses simplified detector geometries and particle-material interactions, hence mapping the detector response into a parametric function. Nevertheless, this technique is limited by its exclusiveness to a specific detector geometry at a time, with any detector changes requiring the framework to be adjusted accordingly through hand-coding. Falcon (previously Turbosim), a fast stimulation framework that uses non-parametric methods to discern detector responses without the need for hand-coding.

Files and file metadata are downloaded on demand and aggressively cached.\nHence we can utilize the lazy load capabilities of CVMFS with various container engines to get the containers running faster than usual.

To move their large data around, CERN uses a service known as Rucio. In order for scientists to be able to perform analyses on Rucio-managed data using SWAN, it must be made accessible from within the notebook. This could be done in several ways, one of which is telling Rucio to replicate the requested data to a specific storage location. To do this, scientists must use Rucio CLI or web-based UI, which could be somewhat overwhelming for some. In addition to that, they must know which storage location the data must be replicated to, and the file path to access the data once replicated. Also, the path can change after sometime, forcing them to go through the process again.</p>\n<p>To address the issue, this project aims to develop a JupyterLab extension that integrates with Rucio.

It is concerned with the computation of topological invariants of curves on surfaces. The goal of this project is to add a new functionality to this package in order to decide if an input cycle on a given surface can be continuously deformed to a simple curve, i.e. a curve without self-intersection. The goal is to implement the algorithm described in this paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09327\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09327</a> (Computing the Geometric Intersection Number of Curves. Vincent Despré and Francis Lazarus. Journal of the ACM 66(6), Article 45, Nov. 2019.). The implementation will strongly rely on the current package functionality for the homotopy test.\nAnother interesting possibility could be to add a new functionality to this package in order to repair mesh surfaces that contain undesired non-trivial topology (small handles or tunnels). A first step is to compute a shortest cycle that is essential on a given surface, i.e. that is neither deformable to a point nor to a boundary cycle of the surface.

Google Gson is a widely used library written in java to transform the Java objects to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and vice versa. This library has a total of 143 directories and 255 files out of which 208 are java files.

For some time now, the CircuitVerse community has wanted to refactor the current javascript codebase (sample GitHub issues: #199, #110, #190). \n<em>Testing Simulator Code</em>:  With bug fixes and new features being implemented by a growing community of circuitverse it will be essential to test Pull Requests before CircuitVerse admins and maintainers merge them. so the second part of my proposal is adding tests to ensure the basic functionality of the simulator.\n<em>Electron App</em>: CircuitVerse provides a platform to perform simulations on an online simulator that users don’t have to install, is lightweight and has a lot of features but sadly not everyone has unrestricted access to the internet. This can be one of the reasons why CircuitVerse’s maximum traffic is from developed countries with above-average or good internet connectivity like the USA(26%), India(11%), UK(6%) and Canada(4%). It would be a big step towards increasing accessibility to have an offline App. Hence, I propose the third part of my proposal: An offline electron app for CircuitVerse.</p>\n",

The project is a sister project of the TUF project and both are there for tightening the release process and making releases more secure. Therefore it’s not surprisingly, that in-toto has frameworks in various languages like golang. The golang in-toto framework is missing runlib functionality. The runlib library implements functionality for capturing evidence of a running process. For this project it’s possible to have a look on the python implementation for reimplementing the same functionality in golang. In the end it should be possible to call a function or a group of functions within golang for generating and signing in-toto link metadata.</p>\n",

The generator is updated by employing a policy gradient and Monte Carlo (MC) search on the basis of the expected end reward received from the discriminator model. The reward is estimated by the likelihood that it would fool the discriminator model. We envisage that this approach will result in more fluent and adequate verbalizations. It is also noteworthy that this would be a novel approach to solve the problem statement which has never been previously explored in literature. Closest available research is that of (Yu et al., 2017), however they do not rely on graphical input representations for their model, and employ an RNN based encoding module within their generator network.</p>\n",

Since Cloudflare is holding such a massive portion of internet traffic, the practices Cloudflare is utilizing affects millions of people's access to the internet and their privacy on the internet. Internet users have widely demonstrated Cloudflare's discriminatory practices against anonymous Tor users and web browsers on online forums and research papers. These practices limit or completely block webpages' functionality for \"certain\" users by implementing endless CAPTCHA loops. Therefore, the \"Cloudflare CAPTCHA Monitoring\" project aims to track how often Cloudflare fronted webpages return CAPTCHAs to Tor clients. The project achieves this by fetching webpages via both Tor and other mainstream web browsers and comparing the results. The tests are repeated periodically to find the patterns over time. Collected metadata, metrics, and results are analyzed and displayed on a public dashboard to understand how Cloudflare manipulates internet traffic and affects people's access to the internet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/woswos/CAPTCHA-Monitor/-/wikis/home\" target=\"_blank\">Project page and documentation</a></p>\n",

          "description": "<p>SWT is a Java widget toolkit currently under Eclipse that delegates the heavy work to the native operating system. This renders it performant speed in drawing widgets. An unsolved bug that lasted for 2 years has been the Vertical Slider issue. SWT uses GTK for Linux, Cocoa for Mac, win32 for windows for drawing its widgets. Linux Tools relies on SWTChart for OS dependent widgets. A complete migration of Linux Tools  to SWTChart has been proposed. SWTChart is a library built on SWT with a flexible MVC structure. The Data Model is a unique tree structure. Unlike the current Data Models, it shall set most of its data at compile time after validation through Graph algorithms .</p>\n",

The ongoing pandemic Covid-19 has enforced self-quarantine for millions of people around the world. The opportunity and requirements for telework and online collaboration arise. This collaboration can be used for various purposes such as mentoring sessions, code reviews, and co-editing. In Eclipse Che 6 and GWT editor, Teletype libraries were integrated to bring live collaboration capabilities. However, Che 7 and Theia IDE lack those capabilities. In previous work, I developed a VS Code extension which enables users to join the portal launched from an Atom editor.

One of the components of Eclipse 4diac is the 4diac IDE which is an integrated development environment for modeling distributed control applications compliant to the IEC 61499 standard. The current version of 4diac IDE does not support the validation of the models, which makes it difficult for users to get design-time feedback on inconsistencies regarding the models developed in 4diac. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) could be a solution to find issues in 4diac models since it provides capabilities for specifying generic constraints a model has to fulfill. The aim of this project is to develop OCL constraints and well-formedness rules to the metamodels of 4diac in order to improve the usability of the IDE.</p>\n",

First, before the GSoC 2020 starts, I intend to complete a Python API for retrieving the annotation dataset. Throughout the GSoC 2020, I will modify existing parsers and create neural networks to project semantic frames and frame elements to unannotated sentences. I mainly work with projections on the manually aligned sentences and aligned sentences generated through transitivity. In addition to suggesting techniques for tackling m:n alignment, I also propose metrics for evaluating the projections in binary and graded manners as well as a phraseological method for analyzing projections for metaphorical phrases. If time permits, I would create sentence alignment models for aligning EN-JP, EN-FR, EN-UR, and EN-HI sentences.</p>\n",

This is important to obtain fine grained semantic representations of events and entities. Moreover, the video may be presented in multiple languages that need to be detected and translated to Portuguese. Also individual objects within a video need to be tracked and identified to generate corresponding textual frame elements that can speed up the annotation process.</p>\n",

The FreeBSD core dump facility preserves a copy of the contents of system memory to a special disk partition at the time of a fatal error for later debugging. This copy or “dump” can be a machine-readable form of the complete contents of system memory or just the set of kernel pages that are active at the time of the crash. The state can be recovered by saving it to a file under /var/crash. Kernel core dumps allow us to examine the state of the kernel after a kernel panic or hang. Currently, there is no automated test suite in FreeBSD to verify if all the code paths work. \nThe aim of the project is to create a framework for recovering and testing those kernel dumps for a different set of configuration variables or code paths while logging every test case separately in a log file and later analyzing which code paths failed.</p>\n",

We use these services, in tandem with a test running program and some scripts which I co-authored, to check for compile errors, to check for function correctness using google tests and to do A/B testing for merge requests on master. The testing suite I helped write runs all the aforementioned checks on master and then reports back to GitHub by posting a pull request comment with diff images for manual review if there are any discrepancies. I plan to implement a very similar system for freetype using my past experiences.

FreeType is packed with a lot of complex font-related features, therefore, logging is an important aspect for this library. Freetype uses a home-brewed tracing and debugging facility which is well thought and designed but there is a limitation of this facility to write logs only on platforms that have inbuilt support for standard error. Therefore, this facility fails on platforms lacking standard error. Since FreeType is used on a variety of platforms, there is a strong need to enhance the current logging facility beyond a standard error in order to ease the development and debugging.\nThe idea under this project is to enhance the existing design of writing logs to standard error to writing logs to the file system considering almost all platforms support input/output to files. \nThere are multiple logging libraries that are freely available in the market and are stable, which will do the job of printing logs to a file.\nHence, this project involves exploring the existing logging libraries, selecting one of them, integrating the same in FreeType and finally touching upon the testing part.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Distance fields looks similar to rasterized images but are very different from them. In the context of fonts, each pixel in a distance field image (or bitmap) is a shortest value from that pixel's position to the nearest edge of the outline of the corresponding glyph.\nDistance field is also known as distance transform and have various applications such as image processing, path-finding etc, but the main motive behind this project is to support high quality text rendering in real-time graphics applications (such as games). So, while rendering distance fields in such applications, the renderer can simply check the pixel's value and discard ones that are greater than a specific range. This makes distance fields almost infinity scalable without losing quality, this means you can use a 128x128 resolution distance transform and it will provide better quality than a 4k resolution image and will also require much less space. Moreover they can also be used to add many types of cool effects, like halos, drop shadows, bluring etc.\nSo, the goal of this project is to add support for generating signed distance fields from font files in FreeType.</p>\n",

It is used in communication with kernel i.a. to update routing tables. There areseveral different methods for reading kernel routing table information, updating kernel routingtables, and for looking up interfaces. One of them is Linux Netlink - asynchronouscommunication between kernel and user. FRRouting with its dataplane abstraction, uses aqueue of dataplane context objects for messages waiting to be sent. A separate thread loopsover this queue and sends the context objects to the appropriate dataplane. Every singlemessage is handled and sent separately, but there’s room for improvement. Certaindataplanes allow for sending multiple messages to them at once, so we could benefit from it.This would improve overall processing time.

          "description": "<p>Uniform sampling from convex polytopes in high dimensions is very useful in many scientific fields and applications. The package volesti is a C++ software with an R interface in CRAN which provides 4 geometric random walks for uniform sampling from convex polytopes among other algorithms in the field of geometric statistics. A classical and difficult problem is to know when the Markov chain converges to the target distribution in order to stop sampling. Diagnostics are tools that can be used to check whether the quality of a sample generated with an MCMC algorithm is sufficient to provide an accurate approximation of the target distribution. The goals of this project are to provide: i) three diagnostic tools for a random walk to check convergence to the target distribution, ii) efficient implementations of all the known geometric random walks for uniform sampling from convex bodies, that are not implemented in volesti and iii) an improved implementation for Billiard walk which is already implemented in volesti. The diagnostic tools would allow us to compare the mixing time of various random walks, which is a classical and hard problem in high dimensional statistics.</p>\n",

The proposed system consists of 3 main components such as Schema Service, Schema Repository and Schema UI. Schema service is designed as a REST full web service and mainly it manages GA4GH JSON Sachems. Schema Repository is the persistence layer for Schema Service and JSON schemas can be stored within the schema repository for retrieval.

While GNSS can provide us precise positions estimation, the GNSS signal can be easily affected by some error sources, for example, jamming signal in this project. \nIn this project, our main hypothesis is that jamming signals can be considered as outliers (either in time of frequency domain) to the received GNSS signal. To mitigate those outliers,  robust version of cross-ambiguity functions (CAFs) are introduced with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator under heavy tailed distribution and M-estimator. Thus we can reduce the affect of jamming signals in terms of outliers and make GNSS more robust.</p>\n",

Haskell IDE Engine (HIE), the most popular implementation of the language server protocol for Haskell, is a great example of this. While it is an incredibly useful tool, its variable performance interferes with the productivity of Haskell developers.</p>\n<p>Profiling tools is another area where the Haskell ecosystem is lacking.

Besides that, hydrus supports a basic two-factor authentication using user-nonce and user credentials. The security feature could be greatly improved if we could have a straight-forward way to create an API gateway to the hydrus instances. Also, the hydrus codebase has to be refactored for better readability / maintainability of the code. The current database schema can also be improved which would make hydrus more efficient.

Currently, Brian uses <code>brian2tools.nmlexport</code> package to elegantly export Brian models to <code>NeuroML</code>.

However, the fMRI data modeling performed by TVB suffers from the drawback of considering a standard model for the underlying Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF), throughout a brain and across various brain models. Several studies have indicated that HRF shows variability across both the subjects and across various brain regions of a particular subject. To account for the same, we aim at extending the rsHRF-toolbox  to interface between estimating region-specific resting-state HRF (rsHRF) from fMRI data, and modeling BOLD activity in TVB. The extended toolbox shall take fMRI data as input, estimate the region-specific rsHRF for regions (network nodes) defined by the connectome used in TVB, and mediate the fMRI data simulations through TVB's Bold monitor and BoldRegionROI monitor while accounting for the underlying HRF variability across the network. We also aim to build a GUI interface for the toolbox and consequently a docker implementation for the same as we expect end-users from various communities and backgrounds.</p>\n",

A natural extension of this model was proposed in a paper by Joglekar et. al . Instead of using non-linear firing rate models, the cortical area was simulated as a spiking neuronal network. This was extremely useful to investigate the propagation of activity in the synchronous and asynchronous regime of the network. My goal in this project is to convert this model to PyNN allowing the simulation in several simulators.  As a secondary goal in this project, I would like to convert the model proposed by Demirtas et. al.   that is a large-scale circuit model of human cortex incorporating regional heterogeneity in microcircuit properties inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for parametrization across the cortical hierarchy and fitting models to resting-state functional connectivity.</p>\n",

I would propose to use model parameter optimization based on bifurcation analysis. This would use computational tools based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems to generate maps of parameter space that indicate the location of bifurcations at which one type of model behavior transitions into another type. These models may use many unknown parameters and specific weights. We can construct a network by fixing the known parameters and train it on input and output to determine the unknown parameters. I believe a bifurcation analysis of this model would provide solutions for sets of states for a given set of parameters. The way we adjust parameters and weights we may analyze the computations of a neural system in how it generates ideas from the organization of a network.

These features and extensibility have made Inkscape the wonderful software it is today.\nBut, these features come with a cost, i.e. difficulty accessing these features. Currently, operations have to be searched through highly nested and huge drop-downs. Also, you have to remember where the option was. Keyboard shortcuts don't solve the problem due to their learning curve, system shortcuts, and the limit on the number of keys that can humanly be pressed.\nCommand Palette(CP) is an interactive search bar that can search any operation (extensions, edits, filters, etc.) that Inkscape provides. CP is also a tool for the <strong>power users</strong> It speeds up the access times by using commands that help users to bypass the slow GUI and use mostly their speedy keyboards.\nAnother problem is repetition. The ordered nature of most drawings calls for repetition.

Features such as: <em>path simplification</em>, <em>path flattening</em>, <em>line scanning (flowing text)</em>, <em>path offset/inset</em>, <em>boolean operations</em> and some modes of <em>tweak tool</em>. While livarot is functionally good, it's quite outdated. It was written in 2003, it's extremely hard to understand it or maintain it. The goal of this project is to implement all of these features either in lib2geom or outside it while using lib2geom's features as much as possible.</p>\n",

The native mode is still in early development stage and the performance has not been tuned yet.</p>\n<p>This project focuses on the native conv2d layer optimization with c/asm on Intel CPUs. Firstly, we will do some research on how to implement conv2d layer in a way which is convenient to operate parallelly. Secondly, write the corresponding C code for preliminary optimization.

While developing Elytron the idea was to provide a better and stronger authentication and build something that does more than just unifying the security solution. Intrusion Detection using Elytron is aimed at doing the same i.e. to extend Elytron’s functionality. \nIntrusion Detection is the art of sensing when a system or network is being used inappropriately or without authorization. Without intrusion detection, an attacker can attempt attacks many times until an attack is finally successful. Intrusion detection allows for these attacks to be identified before a successful attack is likely to occur.  The purpose of this project is to implement an Intrusion Detection system that detects suspicious activity or a potential attack and report it to the administrator.</p>\n",

The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, etc within the system. It does this by maintaining a local XML-based database. This leads to dependence on the physical disk of the Jenkins master. Hence, the core idea of this project is to extend Jenkins core to support storing of fingerprints in an external storage, which would be managed by storage system specific plugins. This would involve designing and creating the external fingerprint storage API. The API would also allow multiple Jenkins instances to store their fingerprints inside a single external storage instance, enabling traceability of artifacts across the CI/CD flow. The project also involves creating two plugins, as reference implementations. These plugins would allow users to store fingerprints inside their Redis and PostgreSQL instances.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Cantor is an application that lets user use their favourite mathematical applications from within a nicely KDE-integrated worksheet interface. It offers assistant dialogs for common tasks and allows users to share their worksheets with others. Cantor is one of many KDE educational projects. It supports a variety of backends, be it Maxima, Octave, Python, R and many more and that too packed in a single intuitive GUI. The current version of Cantor does not have support for viewing backends' documentation inside the application itself. For example, to view Maxima’s documentation or help, the application provides an external link pointing to the Maxima’s official documentation page which is opened in a fresh browser window. This has the obvious drawback of requiring an active internet connectivity.</p>\n<p>The proposal for this project is to integrate the help or documentation inside Cantor’s settings. The implementation should be done in such a way to provide integrated search and context sensitive help facilities.</p>\n",

OpenLDAP is an old and complex method of authenticating and managing user identity and several modern approaches are available. Moreover many services do not support OpenLDAP authentication (Eg. discourse). One of the newer approaches is to use OAuth2. OAuth2 is a modern approach to authentication and fixes the various issues with LDAP. So, the project also involves migrating <a href=\"https://season.kde.org\" target=\"_blank\">season.kde.org</a> to OAuth and giving it a much needed visual overhaul at the same time.</p>\n",

They allow artists to control different parts of their artwork at once, for instance, color, lighting, lineart, as well as texture. A key feature of them is their ability to be resized, composited, renamed, grouped or deleted independently of the rest of the document.</p>\n<p>Patterns and textures are also essential components of an artist’s toolbox, allowing them to represent the intricacies of a physical material. They come in two forms: bitmap textures, which are images contained in e.g. PNG or OpenEXR files, or procedural textures, which are generated on the fly using their mathematical representation.</p>\n<p>KDE’s Krita painting suite supports using patterns and textures through two types of layers, File or Fill Layers. However, neither of them let artists create dynamically generated content: File Layers are inherently static, and Fill Layers support only color fills (like Paint Layers) or basic pattern rendering.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to let artists create dynamic content through a new, scriptable Fill Layer. To this effect, I propose to integrate Disney Animation’s SeExpr expression language into Krita.</p>\n",

That is the reason that C++ is responsible for handling events and logic, and thus the performance is increased, allowing the visual QML layer to be a simple, declarative layer on top. This is of course reflected in the structure of the controls project: all visual implementations sit in the imports folder, so that developers who want to create their own complete style can do it easily.

Also we have Logger that supports the UI elements of Visual Component Library and some application-specific events can also logged. So The project mainly goals is to Extend the ability of the existing UI testing framework to support the unsupported items that exist now. Then to Increase the ability of the DSL that used for testing by Be able to log more complex events and the events of the new added items that were unsupported before. Also Be able to generate more meaningful test cases with the DSL not just replaying the user action from the Logger. Finally to Add new generic methods for writing test cases for new bugs.</p>\n",

Providing the community with open source tunable memory controller models dedicated to the benchmarking of soft cores will greatly help producing more accurate and interpretable core  and accelerator performance figures without requiring an ASIC tape-out in the first place, which is often not even an option.</p>\n",

Traditional trajectory formats suffer from poor portability, large file sizes and limited ability to include metadata relevant to simulation. The  Trajectory New Generation format developed by the GROMACS team represents the first trajectory format with small file sizes, metadata storage, archive integrity verification and user/software signatures. The refactoring of this code into C++  will provide clarity and usability for both the GROMACS project and for other simulation packages and analysis tools and is the primary goal of this project. Thin FORTRAN and Python layers are also desirable to encourage widespread adoption and are a secondary goal of the project. An efficient and transferable implementation of the TNG format will represent a major step forward for the computational molecular sciences community, enabling easy storage and replication of simulations.</p>\n",

To work around this, extension developers have to get a reference to a visible component as parent under which they create UI views. This, however, defeats the idea of App Inventor, which allows the users to create their UI of their apps using the concept of WYSIWYG.\nMy proposal to solve this problem is to have a generic <code>MockVisibleComponentExtension</code> which can be dragged into the designer. The extension will be just a visible component as opposed to non-visible component. This allows the extension to be placed under a <code>ComponentContainer</code> under which the extension can create its views. This allows the users to view a clear hierarchy of their app's UI when using \"visible\" extension. Then, there will also be a need for <code>MockComponentContainerExtension</code> into which any visible component/extension can be placed.</p>\n",

Instead of having to juggle beatmatching, effects, cues and sliders all at once, a DJ should be able to rely on his tools so he can focus on what really matters. For some, beatmatching and syncing two tracks is an art in itself - for others, including me, it is something happily delegated to the software - that is why there is a sync function.</p>\n<p>But sometimes, more sophisticated automation can be helpful - maybe you want to skip a breakdown, shuffle around verses, loop an intro a specific way or deliberately repeat certain parts. Handling that while messing with effects and getting the next track ready can be tricky, so that is where Mixxx Macros will come in handy.

While making the developments to use the package in ROS2, I will take the opportunity to make improvements in these areas: lowering the technical barrier of entry for the user, improving the Inverse Kinematics especially near kinematic singularities, and allowing the user to customize the package by making it more modular. The development work will be accompanied by extensive documentation, tutorials, and examples. Additionally, the package will be thoroughly tested and will support testing for future updates.</p>\n",

The MoveIt’s RobotState function, “computeCartesianPath”, fulfills only a small part of this demand. OMPL has advanced capabilities to handle constraints that are not integrated with MoveIt yet. Examples of applications that can benefit from this integration are robot welding, grinding, painting, and many more.</p>\n<p>Concretely this would mean integrating OMPL’s Cartesian planning capabilities in the existing planning plugin.

Making the process of contributing to the in-tree docs an enjoyable experience is very important so that more people would contribute to the source docs. Implementing a renderer at review phase would be one of the steps toward that goal since reviewers don’t have to build the docs locally and just access s3 to review the diff and make the code-test-commit-review cycle shorter.</p>\n<p>With MDN de-prioritizing build and workflow docs, we need a suitable replacement for all of Firefox's contribution and workflow documentation. Documentation has been moved to in-tree which offers great advantages such as that it can be updated along with the source. Migrating documentation from MDN is a tedious process done manually since there are no mechanisms to make the migration easier. With the help of a web crawler and pandoc, we could make a script to use the crawler to extract all the documentation from the MDN site and convert it to Rst files that can be added to the in-tree docs.</p>\n",

In the case of Musescore, the code was written manually for QT, with all the drawing and file handling code written manually. So the classes in libmscore follow this tree-like model somewhat informally, but not explicitly. I will be refactoring the code, such that the classes in libmscore follow this model exactly by adding a \"children\" list to the ScoreElement class. Many operations can then be written as tree traversals. This would prevent a lot of duplication in code, and simplify the code in a lot of places.</p>\n",

In this project, we would like to continue the work to develop a C/C++ based optimization plugins that can be used directly by LibRoadrunner with the help of RRPlugins. RRPlugins is a software that uses Libroadrunner as a dependency to load plugins and perform optimization tasks.

To do so, it should invite and fulfill the needs of bioinformaticians and mathematicians while at the same time bridging the gap to wet lab experimentalists. One of these differences is the common preference of wet lab biologists to use spreadsheets, which as of now cannot be used as input for SynBioHub. This can be changed by creating a plugin, which accepts a spreadsheet as input and converts it into SBOL which can be processed by SynBioHub.

In some areas this is a vast oversimplification of the physical reality; light exists on a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. Spectral rendering achieves better accuracy by taking that into account. The major drawback is that it cannot use widely available color data for surfaces such as photographs. The process of gathering usable spectral data is significantly more time- and resource-intensive.</p>\n<p>Spectral upsampling is the process of extrapolating spectral information from RGB color data. This is possible because, in practice, spectral reflectivities, which describe how a surface interacts with incident light on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis, tend to fit relatively simple patterns. The goal would be to add support for several newly published algorithms to Colour, a color science library for Python.

This project will allow researchers to easily deploy these estimators in existing spatial workflows. Specifically, this project will contribute implementation, docstrings, tests, and example notebooks for (1) bivariate local join count statistics, (2) multivariate local join count statistics, and (3) local spatial heteroskedasticity (LOSH) statistics. In the first phase of this project, each estimator will be reviewed and pseudo-coded to identify areas of optimization. In the second phase, the estimators will be implemented with tests, with performance assessed against spatial datasets of different sizes. In the final phase, example notebooks will be drafted and polished to a quality ready for external (e.g. workshop) use.</p>\n",

In more recent times, the focus has shifted on pangenomes, that encode genomic variation across multiple individuals of a certain species.\nPangenome graphs (also called Variation Graphs) are used to store and represent pangenomes. Multiple open-source tools have been developed for building and analyzing Variation Graphs and VG (<a href=\"https://github.com/vgteam/vg\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/vgteam/vg</a>) is the most popular one. VG provides a framework to work with Variation Graphs, and it is currently capable of handling moderately-sized graphs. However, it has issues scaling up for large datasets.\nI want to improve its performances by building a highly parallel graph explorer that makes use of GPU architecture in Rust. GPUs are well known for their ability to do millions of operations at the same time, however achieving this requires code to be written in a speciﬁc, parallel-oriented way. I think that, with help from the mentors, this can surely happen, and VG will be able to explore Variation Graphs much faster.</p>\n",

Most of the time a sample from only one organism, of which the genome (and therefore the proteasome) is known, is analyzed. In this case choosing a suitable database does not pose a problem.<br>\nHowever if the sample contains one or multiple unknown organisms, it can be difficult to choose an adequate database. Nevertheless there are multiple approaches to solve this, but those methods frequently depend on assumptions and are therefore not guaranteed to generate a suitable database.<br>\nBecause of that it would be valuable to be able to score those databases. Thus ensuring the most suitable one is used.<br>\nTo achieve this, <em>de novo</em> sequences are derived for mass spectra and appended to the given protein database. Subsequent a standard protein search engine is run. The number of <em>de novo</em> and database sequences are counted after some false discovery rate determinations.

          "description": "<p>The usual approach taken in computational chemistry is to first run a simulation, which can often be long, on a target molecule and then to analyze the results to obtain an insight about the molecule. Usually, electron density assigned in the atoms that constitute the molecule is a key element in this process. This partitioning of the electrons itself do not suggest any observable properties of a molecule. However, many observable features of a molecule are derived directly from the electron densities, hence motivating chemists to relentlessly improve this <em>noumena</em> step by step.\nCurrently, cclib can calculate some common atomic charge potential methods, including C-squared Population Analysis, Mulliken Population Analysis, and Lowdin Population Analysis. Because Mulliken Population Analysis and Lowdin Population Analysis are similar in its theory (Lowdin uses a different basis set to reduce the basis set dependence observed in Mulliken Analysis), it would be advantageous to have other modern calculation methods implemented in cclib. Some examples of the methods that can be implemented include DDEC6, Hirshfeld method, Bader analysis, ISA (through a bridge to Horton) and so on.</p>\n",

In the area of chemistry, Graph Convolutional Networks, in which compounds and crystals are regarded as graphs, have attracted much attention.Deep learning frameworks for molecules such as DeepChem, Chainer Chemistry, and Deep Graph Library have emerged to more easily exploit these models of deep learning. On the other hand,  these frameworks did not support inorganic crystal and the model support was biased towards Graph Convolutional Networks.JAX Chem is a JAX-based deep learning library for complex and diverse chemical modeling. JAX Chem’s motivation is to support not only models of Graph Convolutional Networks, but also Attention-based models like Transformer,  and  even models for wave functions involving complex physical equations like SchNetOrb or FermiNet. JAX is suitable  for  such  complex  modeling  because  JAX’s  API allows you to write models declaratively.  In the period of GSoC, I will implement the  standard  GNN  model,  the  dataset  utilities  and  the  GCN  model  for  MaterialInformatics, and the Attention-based model, as the beginning of JAX Chem.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Null geodesics refer to the path, that massless particles, such as photons, follow in 4-dimensional spacetime. Accurate numerical computation of these geodesics near Black Holes is paramount to advance our knowledge of the relativistic physics, surrounding these extreme gravitational objects, as the nearest stellar mass black hole is ~3000 ly away, making astronomical observations nearly impractical. Without proper astronomical reference to compare against, it is impossible to obtain data on the line profile of these celestial bodies, due to the appreciable general relativistic corrections required. In this project, we will consider two spacetime geometries, the Schwarzschild and Kerr Metrics, and implement python modules, that (1) help in solving geodesic equations, given initial conditions; (2) raytracing photons (null geodesics); and (3) help in performing some advanced simulations and visualizations, like simulating accretion flow, gravitational lensing and calculations, related to redshifted photons due to the spacetime curvature, near these bodies. We will survey the existing state-of-the-art literature and pick a performant implementation for the two geometries.</p>\n",

However, compared with the state-of-the-art scene text recognition algorithms, the text and digit recognition samples in OpenCV are out of date. These samples are based on traditional classifiers, which is difficult to handle the complex scenarios in the real world. Hence, I propose to improve the text recognition samples with the representative algorithms of scene text recognition from our research group. Specifically, CRNN is a good choice for its high accuracy and efficiency. Because there are some unsupported network layers and operations in OpenCV, I will modify the related parts of the original network. Moreover, it is necessary to accelerate the text recognizor with the CUDA support in OpenCV DNN Module. In conclusion, I propose to implement a fast text recognition sample in OpenCV, and build a complete text spotting pipeline for scene text detection and recognition.</p>\n",

So, we can move the implementation from the repository for non-free modules (opencv_contrib/xfeatures2d) to the main OpenCV repository (opencv/features2d). Besides, there are platform-specific SIMD intrinsics in the implementation and currently the calculation is not deterministic due to floating-point operations, so I will make those codes more general and stable. An extension of the SIFT algorithm, A-SIFT, will also be implemented in C++ on the basis of its Python implementation in the Python modules.</p>\n",

First of all, mapping Vulkan buffer to WebGPU buffer to access the storage of WebGPU.Secondly, mapping Vulkan API calls for pipeline and command buffer to WebGPU API.

There is also another category who have already invested in PostgreSQL servers, where requiring them to install and learn another type of database server would not only be an unnecessary waste of their time, but also a wastage of computer resource.</p>\n<h3>Thus, this project aims to add PostgreSQL to the list of databases that OpenMRS supports.</h3>\n",

But the API as implemented by the FHIR module provides a very minimal search functionality for most of the resources where you can search by either only one or a few search parameters. There is no search functionality using advanced parameters like _include, _sort, _summary etc. Moreover, there are Lucene indices available for some FHIR resources and the search API for FHIR module doesn’t exploit these indices to provide a quicker search.</p>\n<p>This project is aimed at improving the search API and implementing/providing support for more complex search operations. It takes into account implementing the search parameters which have already not been implemented for each of the core resources. It would make use of the Lucene index for resources where it is available. Currently, all the search results are returned by the server corresponding to the set of search parameters specified by the user. But this is not always desirable and it is more efficient to return only the top most useful results at a go and hence, this forms an important part of this project by implementing paging for the resources.</p>\n",

Such a drawing of a planar graph is called a plane drawing. Every planar graph also admits a straight-line drawing, which is a plane drawing where each edge is represented by a line segment.

The algorithm first identifies all of the connected components in the graph, then adds edges to connect those components together in a path. For example, if a graph contains three connected components A, B, and C, make_connected will add two edges. The two edges added might consist of one connecting a vertex in A with a vertex in B and one connecting a vertex in B with a vertex in C.

When the user returns back to a place with access to the internet, the recorded data can be uploaded back to the MapMint server. The aim of the project is to extend Augmented Reality (AR) support in the MapMint4ME application. The motivation for the project was to improve field data acquisition. AR Simulation module provides users capability to visualize 3D objects simulation in real world scenes. AR Area module allows users to export measured \"AR measurements\" into text format and which can be used for further analysis.

To ensure there is no sudden breakage in the existing API, a transition phase is needed to slowly phase out the old API in favour of a unified API.</p>\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\n<p>This project aims to transition the existing API to forward-compatible unified API. \nThe basic details are:\nUsing tag dispatching to enable function overloading, allowing user to select  between different available implementations.\nLack of tags allows PCL to choose best possible implementations, this allows to maintain backward compatibility with current API.\nMissing implementation for a tag raises compile-time errors\nProviding SIMD/OpenMP/CUDA implementations of existing algorithms using the proposed unified API.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Users can design a custom iconic font on the <code>eos-icons</code> landing page by choosing from a wide variety of EOS icons. These can be used in any open source project by following the guides in the documentation page. Currently people can suggest and request new icons and features by opening an issue on Gitlab. The problem here is that most people do not want to sign in to Gitlab to send an issue and want something faster within the same interface of EOS. The aim of this project is to design a scalable backend infrastructure that delivers a web interface allowing users to request new icons in an easy and intuitive way. Users can attach files with the request to explain what they want. The admins or EOS maintainers can then resolve, close and revise these requests. Even users can comment and vote for the existing requests. This can also serve as an efficient feedback and response mechanism which is critical for any organization to improve and make progress. Thus, it potentially becomes another reusable open source project for EOS.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Very often, the QEMU emulator is used to emulate user level processes that are compiled for a different architecture set than the \"host\" machine on which they are running. This operating mode in QEMU is called the user mode and it is much simpler than the more commonly known system mode in which the full computer system is emulated. The user mode is useful for fast cross execution and debugging and is usually executed on Linux based systems. It achieves this cross execution by having its' own implementations of system functions from the Linux kernel interface. Although many system functions are supported in QEMU, the kernel is constantly extended by addition of new system calls. QEMU user mode can't consistently follow this kernel extension and thus many kernel functions are left unimplemented. The goal of this project is to significantly extend this QEMUs implementation of system functions so that many user programs that depend on these system calls can be safely cross executed. This projects' contribution also extends to the Linux Test Project by developing unit tests for system functions implemented within QEMU.</p>\n",

Although various developed countries have already planned how to do it and obtained good results, many developing countries are starting with this titanic challenge. Planning biodiversity inventories involves a series of complications that derive not only from economic capacities but also from the difficulty of designing a survey system that warranties registering most species in a region. Planning adequate survey systems is challenging as not only geographical factors influence species distributions. Species distributions depend on complicated relationships between accessible areas, environmental conditions, and biotic interactions. As a survey aims to register species in a region, biotic interaction could be overlooked. However, the relationship between environmental conditions and the geographic configuration is of crucial importance when trying to identify key sites for biodiversity sampling.

Additionally, other features such as quantifying memory allocations, subsequently predicting the space complexity class and classifying complexity for user-defined output parameters (apart from time/memory cases) have been implemented.\nSince algorithms are used in every sphere of research, this package potentially caters to all types of R-users.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>In the R-language, many packages exist for the estimation and forecasting of GARCH processes, including fGarch and rugarch. However, none, to our knowledge, have addressed the issue of robustness toward additive outliers, rather than innovations outliers. Muler and Yohai (2008) proposed two approaches to robust GARCH(p,q) model fitting to avoid bias in the parameter estimates and the preceding kind of over-estimation of volatility following isolated large outlier returns. In the first approach, parameters are obtained by maximum likelihood function using a modified likelihood function based on a bounded loss function. The second approach improves on the first by using a filter that limits the effect of an additive outlier on subsequent predictors of conditional variance. Our proposal is to implement the two approaches by exposing interfaces to a C++ library that can be called from any higher level language for estimating the likelihood functon. We will first develop an R implementation of the robust GARCH(p, q) fitting method, with application examples, and evaluate the performance of the code using as bench- marks selected simulation results from Muler and Yohai.</p>\n",

Among our background references there are Ilmanen (2011) and Engle et al. (2016), both focused on central issues in the subject. The project pertains to the <em>Quantitative Analysis of Active Portfolio Management</em> and the three broad areas under which implementations fall are: (i) approaches to dynamic asset weighting, (ii) return factors and their risk premia and (iii) time-varying expected returns. An integral part of the project consists in collecting financial data of interest, including Profs. Fama-French's academic library, replication data sets underlying research produced at companies such as AQR or Ibbotson Associates (Morningstar) and data from providers like Bloomberg, CRSP, and MSCI Barra. Real-world quantitative data analyses follow both to reproduce target papers and show functionality. Our work is bundled into an open source <code>R</code> package, released on GitHub under the AGPL. We believe that providing a modeling and validation toolbox will add value for the users of the field by allowing them to freely produce and reproduce research.</p>\n",

This time we are aiming for generating these scores as a heatmap(such as the heat maps shown in <a href=\"https://ljmanso.com/sngnn\" target=\"_blank\">https://ljmanso.com/sngnn</a>) which can produce all the scores at once, this will be more efficient and faster than the previous work done.

For a collaborative robot, dealing with objects is a key part of its job and its ability to manipulate objects starts with the accuracy of grasping. Intelligent control of a robotic arm to manipulate objects is based on detecting the object and understanding its pose. Precise 3D poses of the objects are necessary to achieve a successful grasp on the objects. We can use the available data from the surrounding environment to recognize the objects poses. In our environment, the data provided will be RGBD frames. Recent work in Deep Learning has achieved amazing results in the problem of 3d pose estimation using RGBD data.</p>\n<p>In this project, we will work to integrate a pose estimation component to RoboComp using some state-of-art work in Deep Learning.

But when it comes to rapidly prototyping of applications and ease of use of APIs, it lags behind other languages like python which is one of the most widely used languages just because of this reason and also due to the plethora of libraries that it provides. So, binding the C++ APIs and exposing them to the python interface can be helpful in extending the use of innermodel lib to beginner developers with minimal knowledge of programming. By exposing C++ APIs to python we are achieving two things at the same time: getting the performance from C++ and ease of use through python, which can also increase contributions from the dev community and later help in the development of innermodel lib or robocomp in general.</p>\n",

In the current RTEMS version, a lower-priority ready task must wait if all the processors included in its affinity mask are executing higher-priority tasks. Since a lower-priority task can never “dislodge” a higher-priority task that could also execute elsewhere, this may needlessly prevent some tasks from being scheduled, even if some processors idle as a result[1].</p>\n<p>This project aims to add the Strong Arbitrary Processor Affinity (Strong APA) scheduler to RTEMS. Strong APA scheduler would allow higher-priority tasks to be ”dislodged” or moved among processors in order to make space for lower priority tasks that are limited by affinity constraints [1]. Consequently, this would allow RTEMS to achieve improved schedulability (i.e., lower response-time bounds).</p>\n<p>References : [1] Cerqueira, Felipe &amp; Gujarati, Arpan &amp; Brandenburg, Bjorn.

The original Wintermute engine also offered some 3d graphics features using DirectX 8/9. The main goal of this project is to add the Wintermute port to ResidualVM and reintegrate the missing 3d features by providing a OpenGL backend. As a result, ResidualVM will be able to provide support for the Wintermute games which are not already handled by ScummVM, because they use 3d graphics. As a concrete example the Wintermute game Alpha Polaris shall be playable with ResidualVM at the end of GSoC.</p>\n",

We utilize a modern parallelization library, HPX, to develop the parallel solver. The goal of the proposed solution is to achieve full distribution of workload starting from mesh partition to computation of fields at mesh nodes. The following goal is achieved step by step, starting from a simple sequential implementation of 1D nonlocal diffusion. The 1D nonlocal diffusion equation is made multi-threaded to enable concurrent processing within a single node and then is extended to a 2D nonlocal diffusion equation. The 2D nonlocal diffusion equation is then made completely distributed to exploit data level parallelism.</p>\n",

A number of libraries implementing thread-safe (sometimes lock-free) containers already exist that can be used for ideas and where code uses a boost compatible license can be integrated into HPX. In particular, LibCDS, a C++ library of Concurrent Data Structures, will be my interest as it has implemented a series of thread-safe containers using pthread.

Older SVG views have been converted to HTML5 Canvas to make a responsive user interface with enhanced interactivity. A new chart containing a histogram of primitive duration has been created to filter out intervals of a specific duration. This supplements the user experience in discovery of intervals having too long or too short duration. Interpretability of the Gantt chart has been augmented by the addition of traceback lines (from a child interval to its parent) and color highlighting which eventually helps to track down dependent and relevant intervals. The hardware performance counter values have been made more explicit by representing aggregated (minimum, maximum, average) values. The Traveler interface is now equipped with more options for explorative performance analysis, better feature detection, easier artifact isolation, and faster debugging.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>When strace is tracing a process which is in an other process namespace than strace itself, PIDs in system call arguments and return values are printed as PIDs in the target process' namespace. This is normal behavior, as these are the actual values that are passed between the process and the kernel. But it would be useful to have an option for strace to translate these ids to strace's own pid namespace. For example when tracing a process inside a Docker container, the translated PIDs allows us, to access these the processes from the host environment (eg. inspecting processes created by the clone syscall).\nThe goal of the project is to add a flag to strace, which enables this translation.</p>\n",

Moreover, additional branches of the master file are generated upon storing a diff in order to ensure the compatibility of future changes of the base examples with the HOWTOs. This not only allows the original examples to remain educational and general, but introduces a new system of visualizing application-specific complete workflows from both Google Brain and the community.</p>\n",

TensorFlow Graphics already contains  implementations of some key building blocks of Mesh R-CNN, like graph convolutions and the chamfer distance by the time of this writing. However, some other crucial parts of the Mesh R-CNN approach need to be implemented als modules into TensorFlow Graphics.

Each of them has some libraries such as TensorFlow Graphics or Kaolin, which help users to use 3D models in neural networks easily. Unfortunately, none of the three works mentioned above are implemented in TensorFlow Graphics, whereas Kaolin provides their code. This is not a good situation for TensorFlow users who want to try using \"implicit 3D representations\" in their experiments or projects.\nIn this proposal, I propose a project to implement these three works in Tensorflow Graphics.

Camel's out-of-the-box integration components are modeled after the Enterprise Integration Patterns cataloged in Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Wolf's book (<a href=\"http://www.eaipatterns.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eaipatterns.com</a>). Camel allows you to integrate with quite a few protocols and systems out of the box using Camel components. Each component is highly flexible and can be easily configured using Camel's consistent URI syntax. In this project I`m going to add one more component to the camel components collection hopefully it will be a popular and widely used component.</p>\n",

In the process of learning more about Asterix I was shown an out-of-date, never merged branch that implemented an optimized version of interval join. The goal of my project is to update and migrate that interval join code into the active repository. The first part of my project will be to merge the interval join code into my own branch, update it, and update the interval optimization rules. The second part of the project is to update the query parser so that Asterix will run an interval join using the new query plan. The last stage of my plan is to update/create any tests that need to be modified, and perform full scale testing.</p>\n",

This can then be injected as a managed bean in the web application. It would be an even more minimalistic microserver and IoC centric.\nMaking this then natively runnable as a native executable for Windows is delivering important work for future JakartaEE projects within Apache, that need to be turned into a native image (via GraalVM).

We need to build the libraries that will unify this ecosystem and let the developers focus on what matters: building quality VMI apps. This is where libmicrovmi comes into play. It aims to solve this problem, by providing a core, foundation library, written in Rust, to be cross-platform, hypervisor-agnostic and emulator-agnostic, on top of which higher-level libraries and apps can rebase. Rust makes a lot of sense for VMI for 2 main reasons: Rust is safe: considering that we are processing untrusted input from virtual machines, we cannot allow any crash or exploitation in the introspection agent.

In the Bareflank fork of LLVM, this project will create a new group of checks associated with AUTOSAR under clang-tools-extra. Parts of AUTOSAR are based on existing C++ coding standards, but many new additional checks in C++ will need to be written.

          "description": "<p>A leap forward in the accuracy of forecasting problems in chaotic time series has been recently obtained using Echo State Networks (ESN). This is a novel kind of recurrent neural network with a randomly connected hidden layer, called the reservoir, and an adaptable output layer trained using a simple regression algorithm. This architecture has the advantage of faster computation and presents less parameter tuning then a standard neural network. Since their inception there has been a lot of effort towards the improvement of the model and applications have been found in several fields of study: anomaly detections in geophysics , short term predictions in astrophysics and reconstruction of chaotic attractors among others.</p>\n<p>This project aims to build a comprehensive Julia package in which are implemented the majority of the variations of the ESNs presented in the literature. Such an effort would represent the first attempt to create a library for this kind of models in any programming language, and would reap benefits not only for the consequent simplicity of application, but also for showing the actual state of the art in a family of models that has yet to go mainstream.</p>\n",

Recently, new promising classes of high-order methods for the weak approximation of stochastic differential equations were introduced and those solvers are yet to be implemented in the library. On top of that, Julia currently lacks adjoint sensitivity methods for stochastic differential equations. Adding these tools to the broader ecosystem of DifferentialEquations will attract researchers that seek to simulate (or even control) the dynamics as generated by stochastic differential equations.

          "description": "<p>Probabilistic models, which more naturally quantify uncertainty when compared to their deterministic counterparts, are often difficult and tedious to implement. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have greatly increased productivity of probabilistic modelers, allowing practitioners to focus on modeling, as opposed to the implementing algorithms for probabilistic (e.g. Bayesian) inference. Turing is a PPL developed entirely in Julia and is both expressive and fast due partly to Julia’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler being implemented in LLVM.  Consequently, Turing has a more manageable code base and has the potential to be more extensible when compared to more established PPLs like STAN. One thing that may lead to the adoption of Turing is more benchmarks and feature comparisons of Turing to other mainstream PPLs. The aim of this project is to provide a more systematic approach to comparing execution times and features among several PPLs, including STAN, Pyro, nimble, and Tensorflow probability for a variety of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models, which are a class of models that provide a much modeling flexibility and often allow model complexity to increase with data size.</p>\n",

A patch stack is a set of changes that modifies a body of code. Open source development is driven by applying patch stacks to an existing codebase. PaStA helps to analyse them and groups patches based on their similarity. A number of open source projects ( eg. the Linux kernel ) leverage mailing lists to support their development. All communication happens on these lists and contributors send patches to the lists for the maintainers to review. Given a mailbox of such a project PaStA can also map upstream commit references to corresponding patches in the mailbox. One of the major goals for PaStA has been to integrate with Patchwork. Patchwork is a web based patch tracking system. It helps both contributors track the state of their patches and maintainers efficiently review patches. As a first step PaStA can be used to automate the process of adding related patches to a patch on Patchwork. The primary goal of this project is to complete PaStA’s integration with Patchwork.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Given the increasing number of use cases for massively parallel devices (GPUs), solving the problems they bring have become an important research field. One of the main problems that needs to be solved is the long time (latency) that it takes to move data from the computer’s main memory to the device’s memory. Therefore, using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, the proposed solution consists of adding a new functionality to the current OpenMP interprocedural optimization pass, OpenMPOpt, such that the OpenMP runtime calls that involve host to device memory transfers are split into “issue” and “wait” functions. The “issue” function will contain the code necessary to transfer the data from the host to the device in an asynchronous manner, returning a handle in which the “wait” function will wait for completion. The “issue” and “wait” functions will be moved upwards and downwards respectively, until it is illegal to do so. Doing this, the instructions between the “issue” and the “wait” can be executed, while separately doing the data transfer to the device, hence, reducing the time the process is blocked waiting for the transfer to finish.</p>\n",

WebdriverIO v6.0 was released just a few days back, while it's previous version, v5.0 was released in early December 2018. However, many of MediaWiki's repositories use v4.0 which has now been deprecated. WebdriverIO v6.0 brings with it a number of internal improvements that speed up test execution with lower CPU and memory usage. Upgrading to the current version would therefore be very beneficial. For this, a stepwise approach must be devised to first upgrade all repositories to v5.0 and then ultimately to v6.0.</p>\n",

Additionally, I aim to produce guidance material to describe the existing abstractions both in the cursor operations and CRC computing in the VKMS and in the construction of tests that also include knowledge of Cairo.

Smack currently establishes connection between Server and Client using TCP and BOSH. BOSH suffers from high transport overhead as compared to TCP. Also various issues with long polling are suggested to have an impact upon BOSH based systems [RFC 6202 Section 2.2]. WebSocket provides an alternative to the limitation of inefficient communication between the server and the client by providing bi-directional, full-duplex, real-time client/server communications. The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP [RFC 6455].
