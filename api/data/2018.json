Therefore, it is necessary to replace “show” GUI with a more general framework such as Qt5.  3DTK developers have already started this rewriting, and this project is called “qtshow”.  However, “qtshow” still misses a lot of functionality compared to  “show”.  Because of this, I improve these problems and add some features which are in “show” but not in “qtshow”.</p>\n",

          "description": "<h3>The Problem</h3>\n<p>The Universal Space Operations Center is a simple and easy-to-use ground station for space projects. It was initially developed to aid students in their space experiments. Since no experiment is the same, there was a need to create an application that adapted to each project’s needs. In it’s current state, the user has to use a configuration file to state what protocols/variables/graphs he is going to use during his experiment. However, the need to change the application’s layout is evident, and the student should not be forced to close the ground station, change the configuration file again, and re-open the application to resume his experiment. This goes against the initial principle of the groundstation.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>There needs to be a way for the user to quickly and easily adapt the groundstation to his experiment, without having to worry too much about it. The goal of this project is to implement a set of new features that allow the user to manipulate the Ground Station’s data and layout. In order to accomplish this, I plan on creating a tool that allows the end user to specify exactly how he want his station to look and work.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>One of the important functions of satellites is to provide us with weather data allowing us to properly plan and be prepared for adverse weather conditions. Major users of such data are fishermen or sailors. They need to know the positions of dangerous storms, hurricanes etc and allow them to move away from them. Generally, the weather images can be downloaded from the internet, but the ships rarely have an internet connection. Hence for this, one of the solutions is that NOAA weather satellites freely send the weather images and data down to earth continuously. This is perfect for us, the users can simply have a simple and cheap RTL-SDR device and capture this freely available weather data. Currently, this is possible, but there are no opensource tools that come with the complete package. Usually, one software is used to capture and demodulate FM and then the decoded audio is fed into the other software to decode the image. This complex procedure needs a human's manual input and the raw IQ file may be lost in the process. This project intends to solve this. The open source tool that will be developed will have all the required functionalities.</p>\n",

The existing mechanisms involve the HTTP and SFTP in order to transfer the files from the client window. To effectively enable the unified mechanism and collaboration of the files with the quick and reliable way we plan to implement the file upload using Nextcloud API.

It will also support conversion from different binary hair file formats to the new native format. Finally, the addition of an advanced hair shading model that is tuned for production rendering. It is a physically based hair shader that captures the effects of the light scattering through hair fibres. The model is importance sampled and also has various parameters to change physical properties in the hair like refractive index and colour absorption and distribution.

This approach works well when the multicopter is flying at high altitudes without obstructions. In case of low altitude flights though, it becomes difficult for the drone to navigate autonomously and requires sensors to restrain it from colliding with the obstacles around. This is done by locally dividing the regions around the multicopter into sectors and scaling the attitude proportional to the distance from obstacles. This would sometimes lead to the vehicle to stop and a manual intervention would be required to let it out of the obstruction.</p>\n<p>Situations like these could be avoided if a planning algorithm could take advantage of the observations made previously in the form of a 3D map and use it to direct the multicopter in the collision free path maintaining the global plan for waypoint navigation. This could be done by building a framework for mapping which would utilize depth information from stereo cameras or lidars and generate an occupancy map. The planner would use this map and global plan as an input and generate control commands for the multicopter to navigate autonomously.</p>\n",

Its main function is to provide a test running framework that overlaps significantly with Common Test, but it also contains cluster management and code intercept functionalities.

With the number of programmers learning/using machine learning only set to grow, supporting machine learning capabilities is <em>essential</em> for any programming language. Moreover, there are discussions on elixirforum.com regarding this and recent talks given at ElixirConf that reflect the need for Elixir to provide machine learning capabilities.\nI thus propose to work on <em>Tensorflex</em>,  an Elixir framework similar to <em>Keras</em> (for Python). Keras uses <em>Tensorflow</em> as a backend for doing all the ML. Using Native Implemented Functions (NIF) and the Tensorflow C API as a backend, a low-level wrapper will be written in Elixir. This low-level API will then be used to write a Keras-like framework in the form of a high-level API. This will allow Elixir developers to write expedient and efficient machine learning code in Elixir.</p>\n",

This interpretation of real-life objects into 3D space is sufficient for typically solid media such as teapots and chairs. However, this model faces many issues when used to represent dynamic materials such as smoke or clouds, which have innumerable and constant shifts in number and location of vertices, edges, and faces. These types of objects are typically classed and implemented separately as Volumes.</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of the materials involved, Volume rendering requires a different set of solutions in regards to data structuring, light sampling, and so on. Quickly becoming an industry standard, OpenVDB is a Volume rendering framework developed by Dreamworks that sees wide usage throughout the graphics industry such as in Pixar's RenderMan and Houdini. It is known for its efficiency in handling sparse data sets and its wide range of filters, transformation operators, compositing tools, and many other features for the creation and robust manipulation of Volumes. Its integration into Cycles will surely further Blender's usage in the 3D graphics scene.</p>\n",

As a result, various inference can be carried on huge sample sizes at a reasonable computation cost. The idea is to track a small subset of entries in the full frequency spectrum and interpolate to recover the full AFS to proceed with integration for larger sample sizes. The key problem is how to recover the frequency spectrum accurately, so several experiments would be carried out to tune parameters and implementations. Also, a framework is expected to be developed for balancing the trade off between computational complexity and data recovery accuracy, that is, deciding which kind of data should be computed with approximation and which should be computed directly.</p>\n",

To remedy this, those classes should be broken up into smaller classes with a clearly defined responsibilities, as well as their usages reevaluated and refactored as well. Existing unit tests are to be refactored and new tests of formerly hard to test parts are to be written.\nA good example is the Formula object in catrobat, since it is pure business logic, but currently calls a number of singletons and needs a context which can be refactored quite easily and have unit tests put in place.</p>\n",

This algorithm has a lot of potential owing to the fact that it can generate data that is quite similar to the data given for learning in addition to faster generation of samples when compared to fully visible belief nets. It therefore makes GANs immensely useful in simulation of particle physics and astrophysical data.</p>\n<p>Since ROOT is a data analysis tool extensively used for applications in particle physics and features a dedicated machine learning submodule, Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA), it is essential to include a GAN implementation in the toolkit.</p>\n<p>My project would focus on integrating an optimized GAN implementation in the TMVA DNN library with the help of already existing implementations of Deep Network Models.

Its goal is to facilitate in-depth studies of silicon-based particle and radiation detectors widely used in high-energy physics. During simulation, Allpix-Squared run events that contains a series of modules that operate on input data — usually in the form of a previous module’s output data. These events aim to mirror the behavior of a particle interacting with a specific detector hardware. Some modules are independent of others, so they can be run in parallel; this is the current state of the multithreading used in the framework, but it does not make good use of available CPU cores. The aim of this proposal is thus to run full events in parallel instead, greatly enhancing CPU core utilization. This however requires some internal restructure and presents new problems not shared with the current approach, such as the issue of event execution order. I aim to solve this issue with dependency graphs. When done, the new multithreading approach should allow better execution time, independent on core count and simulation parameters.</p>\n",

The ROOT software framework is foundational for the HEP ecosystem, providing capabilities such as IO, a C++ interpreter, GUI, and math libraries. It uses object-oriented concepts and build-time modules to layer between components.\nThis project aims to provide additional functionality using a package manager over the minimal base install of core features. It involves defining ROOT modules, packages and package manager, mainly to scale the large codebase of the project. The current development involves creating a modular version of ROOT that provides a minimal base install of core features, then later adding functionality using the package manager.

I think that the first goal --- making a \"turf cutting\" extension for CiviCRM using Leaflet --- is a good baseline goal for the summer. I have a prototype that communicates with CiviCRM using the REST APIs, so it's in reach.</p>\n<p>The second goal --- integration with a mobile canvassing app --- is a stretch, but worth working towards too. I've been rewriting the open-source canvassing app, Field The Bern, to be independent of Bernie infrastructure, and think it's a great candidate for CiviCRM integration. If time permits, I'd like to work on a CiviCRM extension to integrate with phones running Field the Bern.</p>\n",

Lemmatization is the process by which inflected word-forms are grouped together under their dictionary headings. This allows us to gather accurate word-usage statistics, analyze authorship, and model subject matter in classical corpora. However the CLTK lemmatizer is not currently able to identify synonyms for a given word, or suggest translations into other languages.</p>\n<p>I propose to modify the existing CLTK lemmatizer to look up synonyms and translations for Latin and Greek. I will adapt CLTK’s unique ‘backoff’ approach to lemmatization in order to measure the probability of each possible synonym and/or translation for a target word given its context. Further, I propose to incorporate vector models for Latin and Greek based on word embeddings trained using the word2vec algorithm. Once synonyms, translations, and vector models are incorporated into CLTK, users will be able to perform cutting-edge tasks like sentence length document alignment. This will open new horizons for digitally assisted classical scholarship.</p>\n",

The final system also involves the production of word embeddings for Sumerian which can be documented and used for improving other downstream tasks like POS tagging, dependency parsing, etc. The developed SRL system will have many potential applications, viz. in the fields of document summarization, machine translation and also towards a better abstract semantic representation of the originally sparse textual data.</p>\n",

This means that we are not limiting ourselves with just the similarity between words, instead we take a step further ahead to also define the relatedness between the vectors and thus the relation between the entities and the text. Therefore, to incorporate this measure of the semantic distance, we define a measure of descriptiveness of the class that these entities belong to. Entities belonging to a class that has a very high level of description must have very low semantic distance in our model. Eventually, we extend the usability by predicting embeddings for out-of-vocabulary entities as well, and also extract relations between those entities using approaches that have been previously used for link prediction tasks in machine learning.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The increasing number of sensors orbiting the earth is systematically producing larger volumes of data, with better spatiotemporal resolutions. To deal with that, better accurate machine learning approaches, such as Deep Learning (DL), are needed to transform raw data into applicable Information. Several DL architectures (e.g. CNN, semantic segmentation) rely only at spatial dimension to perform, for example, land-cover/land-use (LCLU) maps, disregarding the temporal dependencies between pixels observations over the time. Also, high-res remote sensing data (e.g. Planet, Sentinel) may provide more consistent time-series, that can be use in the identification of important LCLU classes, like crop, pastureland and grasslands.</p>\n<p>This potential can be explored using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a specific family of DL approaches which can take into account time dimension. A promising project idea would be implement a RNN approach (e.g. LSTM) to classify a Sentinel time-series that is able to produce a map for one or more LCLU classes and ship the final version of the model into the Pycoal library as part of the COAL project.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>I propose to work on a tool that, given JVM bytecode, decides for each method, whether it performs an effectful computation (including IO, global variable mutation etc.), or it is referentially transparent, that is it yields the same result everytime it is called with same arguments. Such functions are called 'pure functions'. The tool is also supposed to provide information about whether the return type can be the special <code>null</code> value, requiring a <code>Maybe a</code> during Eta-interop. Automated analysis for such data can simplify the development process, by enabling an ffi-generator to generate bindings for Java , ideally without requiring any manual input from the developer. Since the project is mostly exploratory, the analysis is intended to be conservative, but never wrong, in the sense that it should not recommend a return type of <code>a</code> for a function that may return <code>null</code>, but may recommend <code>Maybe a</code> for a function that never returns <code>null</code>. But the aim is to, of course, minimize the number of such cases.</p>\n",

Its goal is to “create a Fedora Edition for Internet of Things, which will make Fedora the default for open source innovation on IoT hardware, middleware and backend platforms”.\nMany IoT devices have special requirements for operation and automation. Among these is the requirement to not break upon operating system upgrades. As part of Fedora IoT, Peter Robinson ideated the Atomic Host Upgrade Daemon, which builds on the Atomic Project and rpm-ostree, a project also labeled “Git for Operating Systems”. This monitoring daemon will re-use the work done for Atomic Updates for IoT system, allowing for automatic checking for available upgrades, applying them, rebooting, checking the system status and, in case of errors, rolling back the changes.</p>\n",

Therefore we can now move to further enhancement like push-notifications of bookmarked events by any user, also we need to improve the user interface for the <strong>dark theme</strong> enabled recently to project. The present testing suite requires some more tests for the functionalities like direct linking of tracks and rooms so the aim is to write <strong>mocha unit tests</strong> with selenium webdriver for the recently added features and the proposed ones. The travis build for the selenium tests run for around 20 minutes, which is quite large so the aim is to <strong>parallelize the build</strong> so that multiple builds can be performed at the same time and runtime can be decreased significantly.</p>\n",

The goal of the project is to convert all the PCI drivers attachments to be table driven and mark with PNP_INFO. \nThe devmatch infrastructure gives us a way to match up hardware with kernel modules that implement drivers that claim the hardware. The problem is that the drivers need some modification before devmatch can use them. Specifically, they need to have their device ID scans done via a table, and that table needs to be decorated with a PNP_INFO tag so the compiler and kld_xref extract the metadata that devmatch needs to do this job. As the PCI drivers are all over the place in terms of how they match device IDs work will be needed to move some of the in-line code to tables, some of the tables lookups may be able to move to standardized routines, etc. Trimming GENERIC to show that the drivers work is also required.\nThere are about 243 such PCI drivers. grep -r 'DRIVER_MODULE.<em>, pci,' </em> | wc is used to find out.

          "description": "<p>In Comparative Genomics we compare an unknown gene with some other known genes, for better inference of biological properties of that unknown gene. Identification of Gene Orthology Relation is the most important task of Comparative Genomics, as they tend to preserve similar molecular and biological functions. Thus if we can establish orthology relationships between two genes, we can obtain valuable evolutionary history of the two genes. However, with advanced sequencing depth and expansion in transcriptome data, genes are no longer the proper units for interrogation in functional conservation, evolutionary events, and expressional patterns, especially in the field of alternative splicing. As the accumulation of transcriptomic data, alternative splicing is taken into account in the assignments of gene orthologs and the orthology is suggested to be further considered at transcript level. Whether gene or transcript orthology, exons are the basic units that represent the whole gene structure; however, there is not much reported study on how to build exon level orthology in a whole genome scale. Therefore, it is essential to establish a transcription oriented gene orthology algorithm.</p>\n",

A second metric could be the performance of the model in language specific tests. Last but not least, we could evaluate the model in real world data offered by Official Greek Government's Gazette (FEK-ΦΕΚ) for named entities extraction and  document categorization as mentioned in the ideas list of GFOSS for GSOC 2018.\nWith respect to sentiment analysis, I would like to implement a binary classifier that, given a piece of text in Greek language, can computationally identify and categorize  the opinions expressed and more specifically to determine whether the writer's attitude towards the topic is positive or negative. The classifier will also return a polarity score which will serve as a measure of confidence of the classifier for its’ decision.</p>\n",

This choice makes sense especially when considering how faster new features can be implemented in Shell and Perl scripts, rather than writing them in C.

It should also be able to provide the users, an easy method to select and execute the corrections suggested and enable/disable the feature. This could get tricky as Octave comes in both a GUI and a CLI. Therefore, for a successful integration of this feature with Octave, understanding how its parser, error handling, and internal functions work would be essential. The next part of the problem would be to generate the words to suggest. A trivial solution of this problem is easy but computationally expensive and hence not feasible. The challenging part therefore, is to minimize the speed-accuracy trade-off of the feature. A starting point for that would be a smart (probability based for example) implementation of the Edit-distance algorithm, using dynamic programming. Later, a Neural Network based idea would also be tested. The goal of-course, is to use the algorithm that best minimizes the speed-accuracy trade-off and provides the best UX.</p>\n",

Additional goals include inventory management, where the seller can configure the available stock for an item and will get notified when their stock runs low.

Additionally, the support I build for WebRTC will make it easy to later add WebRTC MediaStreams, allowing for in-game voice chat.

The algorithms that I plan to incorporate in the HIP package have vast applications in actual problems in image processing. Including these algorithms to the existing code base would help more and more users to really use Haskell while working on some computer vision problems and this would make Haskell (kind of) ahead in the race of with functional programming languages such as Elm or Clojure (since their image processing libraries are pretty naive). In this way, this\nproject can substantially benefit the Haskell organization as well as the open source community.

The DevoWorm project(under Openworm) is building a physics-based simulation of mosaic embryogenesis, with application to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This initiative will focus on incorporating secondary data from nematodes into an XML-based computational framework. The model-building will result in an XML specification of embryo physics that describes mosaic developmental process. This specification will be used to build trees and networks that describe relationships between individual cells. This will provide the Openworm Foundation and the larger neuroscience research community with an informatics framework for understanding neural precursor cells and developing nervous systems. It will pave the way to unlock the mysteries of the evolution of a nematode’s nervous system from a single cell to the fully developed nervous system in that of an adult nematode (in this case, the 302 neurons of C.elegans).</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Most of the currently used data is task-based fMRI data i.e. the data acquired when the subject performs an explicit task (such as finger-tapping). It is clear however, that the brain is active even when the subject is not performing a task. In fact, according to certain estimates, task-related changes in neuronal metabolism only account for about 5% of the brain’s total energy consumption. Resting state fMRI is a comparatively newer approach used to identify synchronous BOLD changes in multiple brain regions while the subjects lie comfortably in the scanner without performing a task. The correlations between spontaneous BOLD signals can be used to study intrinsic functional connectivity. The analysis is also useful in situations where it is advantageous to explore the brain’s functional organization in neurological or psychiatric diseases. INCF currently has a tool to retrieve the hemodynamic response function at rest from resting state fMRI, however, the code is currently written in MATLAB. In order to increase its diffusion and portability, the repository has to be converted to Python and follow the BIDS - Standards to eventually create the portable neuroimaging pipeline.</p>\n",

So it plays an important role for the overall user experience of Plasma.

For that, it is necessary to port the KCMs to Qt Quick, which is quite tedious work and requires a lot of manpower. My primary goal is to help the KDE Community in this immense task, by porting the keyboard input modules, with modern designs provided by the KDE Visual Design Group (VDG).</p>\n<p>Another additional goal is to integrate the input method configurations, such as ibus or fcitx, into the System Settings application.

In this case the data is the image component coordinates composing the mask. Programming AVX can be done using Vc optimization library, which manages low level optimization adaptable to the user processor features.

On desktop, this situation prevents writing clients, bots and bridges that can interact with encrypted rooms in any other language than javascript. Tackling this issue would benefit the matrix ecosystem by seeing more featureful projects emerge in a variety of languages (Python in this case).

Basically when facing situations similar to what we have encountered before. This phenomenon signalled the development of many mathematical models of similarity.</p>\n<p>Metric learning is one amongst those models that perform the task of devising similarities over objects. It has a plethora of applications in fields like information retrieval and recommendation system. Also, many machine learning approaches rely on some metric. This includes unsupervised techniques such as clustering, supervised procedures like KNN classification and semi-supervised modes as well. Metric learning has been involved as a preprocessing step for many of these approaches.</p>\n<p>Henceforth learning a neat distance metric is a crucial task for forming similarities.

          "description": "<p>Recommendation systems are widely used in various online and offline platforms, collaborative filtering being the most commonly used method for implementing them. Most collaborative filtering algorithms, including the ones existing in mlpack, use matrix factorization for this. Although MF is de facto, it cannot deal with complex user-item relationships and also need the user to provide ratings explicitly (explicit feedback). This project proposal deals with these drawbacks by implementing a module for neural collaborative filtering, which can represent complex user-item interaction using neural networks and also can handle implicit feedback (comprising any interaction user has with any item as a positive instance). Neural collaborative filtering, if needed, can also be generalized to matrix factorization. NCF has been proved to give better hit ratio and other metrics than neighborhood based algorithms, and also gives comparable RMSE with existing CF methods in mlpack. This module can give much more flexible recommendations, even when there is less explicit feedback available.</p>\n",

This means that the base engine only provides the bare minimum to create a functioning sandbox environment. Content is provided through modules which build on, tweak and integrate with both the engine and each other. This creates a wealth of content for the player to choose from.<br>\nOr at least that is the intention. Currently the major content for Terasology is extremely similar to content seen in other games like Minecraft, MineTest and similar sandbox games. However due to how modular the design is, it has the potential to have a breadth of content that eclipses either of those two. Which is where this project comes in.</p>\n<p><strong>GooeyDefence</strong><br>\nTower Defence is a very well known game genre, and one that is also consistently popular. This project aims to add a tower defence game mode to Terasology, with a sandbox spin on it. The game mode allows for modular tower building and freeform block placement. It is intended to show off the best of Terasology and thus is designed to be extremely extensible as well as to use content from other modules.<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DN4LxL8nSd9ZUbqhpXIfasmm8PQykJonOw7nUpKXpoo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">The original proposal can be seen here</a></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n",

Communication becomes essential between the various components when scaling the infrastructure. Mozilla uses Pulse to enable an exchange of information Mozilla’s systems.

A significant challenge in the systems biology field is the reproducibility and reusability of such models and making these accessible to the broader biology community. To address this issue, computer-readable formats and tools for modeling complex biological systems have been developed. Standards such as Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) and tools like Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (SBSCL) can represent such complex biological models and numerically simulate them. But until now only a subset of these standards have been implemented in SBSCL. Essential features that will catalyze reproducibility, exchangeability, and reusability are lacking so far.

The current DNAplotlib only support SBOL 1.0 documentation, and thus is only capable of manifesting DNA components consisted of DNA sequence and sequence annotation. It cannot represent complex interactions between different subcomponents, and thus has poor connectivity with other genetic platforms.

          "description": "<p>Details of deep learning models and their performance are, unfortunately, often published without accompanying implementation code. Those models that come from speech recognition seem to be particularly susceptible to this phenomenon. The present project proposes to create a working implementation of a speech recognition model using the Flux library for the Julia programming language and contribute its code to the Flux model zoo. The model to be implemented is Zhang et al.'s (2017) model from their paper \"Towards end-to-end speech recognition with deep convolutional neural networks.\" Due to being implemented using only convolutional layers, this model will be lighter to train than previous models that have used heavier recurrent layers, while still achieving state-of-the-art performance. Having a working implementation of this network will be a step forward in opening the culture of automatic speech recognition. As a result, newcomers to the field will have a recent example to look at for inspiration, which is paramount because there are not many novice-friendly resources available for doing speech recognition research.</p>\n",

However, a wide range of modern N-body hydrodynamics simulations now use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) which produces data consisting of volume filling fields. The current implementation of yt takes this data fills a global octtree, and then treats it similarly to that of AMR data.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage of this treatment of SPH data is that it is not intuitive to users, it is slow and it does not represent the underlying nature of the data.</p>\n<p>This project aims to develop a yt API for SPH data that ensures all SPH fields return data defined at the locations of the particles. Whilst this would provide a more intuitive way to interact with the data, it is still important to interpolate particle data onto grids, as this is essential in visualisation. This can be achieved by taking inspiration from SPLASH. Thus, at the end of the project SPH fields would be able to be visualised using a \"scatter\" (in technical details) approach, inspired by SPLASH. This would allow the the SPH fields to be interpolated efficiently onto grids.</p>\n",

Not all package maintainers remember to update the feedstock when releasing new versions, however, causing some packages on conda-forge to be out of date. Recently, the conda-forge autotick bot was developed to automatically track out of date feedstocks and open pull requests to bump them to the newest version of the source code.

This project also focuses on streamlining test cases for different geometries and data styles to improve the runtime of tests. Furthermore, the runtime of test suites varies on Linux and OSX, thereby giving us a scope of improvement.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Gensim is an NLP library which claims to be highly effective during training and produce linear performance growth with increasing the number of threads.</p>\n<p>Currently, that is not true on machines with a large number of cores (&gt;10) and large data files. The reason of this is that almost all Gensim models which support multithreaded training work in the following way. There is <strong>single job producer</strong> -- worker which reads the data and pushes the chunks into the job queue. Also, there are <strong>many job consumers</strong> -- workers which pull the chunks and update the model parameters in parallel.</p>\n<p>The problem is that consumers'  code is optimized well, so this leads to <strong>workers starvation</strong> problem. Job producer just can't fill the queue at such a high pace. This is the case even using fastest <code>read the line, split it and yield</code> corpus iterator.</p>\n<p>This problem could be solved by allowing users to pass <code>K</code> data streams (currently only single-stream == single job producer thread is supported), e.g. which point to <code>K</code> large files and use <code>K</code> job producers to fill the job queue.</p>\n",

FBA or, Flux Balance Analysis is the earliest COBRA method and the most widely used. But, currently, we have sub-divisions of metabolic modelling strategies which are uncovering the flaws of FBA. To fix these flaws, we have been developing multiple methods which are also being backed by experimental data. So, now we are integrating data from experiments in the models and developing methods for a much better understanding of the metabolic pathways and functionalities of the organisms. The data-driven approaches provide more information about the models and hence provide us with a deeper understanding of the networks.</p>\n",

There are many good alternative motion planning libraries that could be re-added to MoveIt, including: SBPL, STOMP, ITOMP, DRAKE. This project focuses on the addition of support for motion planning libraries in MoveIt planners. MoveIt only had a single stable motion planning library as its core motion planner, i.e. OMPL. As a part of this GSoC project, motion planning support was extended by making other motion planners (CHOMP) more stable and porting STOMP also to be a part of the MoveIt motion planners family. The MoveIt part of STOMP was ported from the ros-industrial/industrial_moveit repository into moveit/motion-planners. Furthermore, benchmarking package was made to work with other motion planners in addition to OMPL and tutorials for the same were added. Planning Request Adapters were extended to include motion planners like CHOMP, STOMP to be used as an additional step with OMPL or other motion planners to produce better trajectories in different situations. Tutorials for Planning request adapters will also be added in moveit_tutorials repository.</p>\n",

A few examples in the literature use different approaches to the problem, and calculate the different spectrum of the light emitted at different phases of these oscillations.

Astropy aims to provide users packages that improve reuse, interoperability, and interface standards for python astronomy and astrophysics packages. Learn Astropy will help both amateurs as well as professional astronomers and astrophysicists in exploring and implementing the various utilities and functionalities provided by Astropy. It will also simplify the process for anyone who is learning to work with python astronomy/astrophysics packages or anyone developing astronomy software.</p>\n<p>The project involved optimising the dynamic search, making custom Sphinx directives, indexing and tagging of Astropy Learn material.

Unlike\nLandsat images, Sentinel 2 datasets do not include thermal and Quality Assessment bands that simplify\nthe detection of clouds avoiding erroneous classification. At the same time, clouds shadows on the ground lead to anomalous reflectance values which have to be taken into account during the image processing.\nThe project aim is the coding of a specific module for GRASS GIS application which implements the procedure developed within my PhD research. The procedure allows to automatically identify clouds and their shadows in Sentinel 2 images applying some rules on reflectance values (values thresholds, comparisons between bands, etc.). These have been defined starting from rules found in literature and conveniently refined. Then the detection of shadows is improved using an adapted shape index. In order to increase the accuracy of the final results, a control check is implemented. Clouds and shadows are spatially intersected in order to remove misclassified areas. The final outputs are two different vector files (OGR standard formats), one for clouds and one for shadows.</p>\n",

For my GSoC project, I propose to accommodate these changes in pgRoutingLayer plugin code and also make use of the new features introduced in QGIS 3.0 to improve the functionality of plugin’s GUI. Also currently there is no test coverage for plugin code which makes it difficult to change features efficiently, so a complete unit test coverage will be built which not only will help in this project but also in future ventures. In addition to this I propose to add functionality for the proposed stable functions of following families:</p>\n<p>Astar : pgr_astarCost , pgr_astarCostMatrix</p>\n<p>Bidirectional astar : pgr_bdAstarCost , pgr_bdAstarCostMatrix</p>\n<p>Bidirectional Dijkstra : pgr_bdDijkstraCost , pgr_bdDijkstraCostMatrix</p>\n<p>Flow</p>\n",

Practically this means that, a WebSocket opened from a page behind authentication  doesn’t “automatically” receive any sort of authentication. That makes possible to establish a connection without authentication making use of http and origin headers field of the client. Some other posible attacks and scans at WebSockets are the classic bruteforce attack, Local and Remote file inclusion, the Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.

          "description": "<p>Ingesting data into PEcAn is currently a user-hostile process for researchers. To simplify this process, the PEcAn team would benefit from an application that can download datasets from any data federation, and parse the metadata so that it can be automatically read into PEcAn. To help further them in this direction, I will create an ingest workflow for a single data federation, DataOne, as a proof of concept. This app will be able to resolve data by doi. I will also add drag and drop functionality to facilitate downloading data from unsupported data federations. This app will then facilitate the process of selecting the correct semantics necessary in order to ingest data into BETYdb (the PEcAn database) by walking the user through this complex process. This app will also serve future development by creating a probability distribution of the semantics selected by the users. This distribution can be used to train a machine learning algorithm that will suggest semantic selection with greater accuracy in the future.</p>\n",

PCP is an open source framework at the system level that monitors, analyze and retrieve information to understand system performance. It has a distributed architecture of agents, called Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDA), that extract performance values from the desired environments or systems.</p>\n<p>Every agent (PMDA) reports to a centralized daemon called Performance Metric Collection Daemon or PMCD per host. Then, accessing any metric is as easy as sending a request to PMCDs. PCP has several client tools to help the final user understand the metrics. Finally, PCP also offers a good API to create an agent for any software.</p>\n<p>Coming back to the interest of the proposal, PCP also supports instrumentation. This is a way to enable user applications like Firefox to send metrics in execution time to the PMDA. In this scenario, Memory Mapped Values (MMV) are used to offer an extremely lightweight mechanism for instrumenting applications using shared memory. However, there is no support for metadata labels added since the newest v4, and hence the goal of this project: add label support for instrumentation.</p>\n",

Since PCP metadata and data keys are distributed across potentially many Redis servers, Redis nodes need to communicate with one another for data access/transfer. Communication between Redis nodes (Redis clients with the Redis servers) is carried out by protocol called RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol). As Redis protocol (RESP) and the pmproxy'd PCP protocol can co-exist, the main goal of this project is extending pmproxy to support RESP such that an arbitrary Redis client can access the distributed key store using the direct key-to-server mapping mechanism used by the existing PCP time series code. Sub-goals include integrating libuv library with pmproxy. libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>One of advantages of document-oriented databases like MongoDB or Couchbase over RDBMSs is an ability to change the data scheme easily, fast and often. The traditional approach in RDBMS world involves doing an expensive ALTER TABLE operation, slow upgrade of an existing data, and stuff like this. This approach is often slow and inconvenient for application developers.\nTo solve this issue PostgreSQL provides JSON and JSONB datatypes. Unfortunately JSONB has a disadvantage of storing all documents keys, which is a lot of redundant data.\nOne possibility to to reduce JSONB redundancy is to use zson extension. It compresses JSONB documents using shared dictionary of common strings that appear in all or most documents. This approach has its limitations though. Particularly, since data schema evolves, the dictionary has to be updated from time to time. Also zson can affect the build-in mechanism of PostgreSQL of compressing data using PGLZ algorithm since this mechanism uses some heuristics to recognize data that compresses well. Thus sometimes zson can reduce the overall performance.\nThe idea of this project is to create an extension that provides Thrift support which solves zson problem.</p>\n",

More details on implementation is in Implementation part.\nAnother feature is the reply-by-email feature using mailman gem.\nFeature that we can implement is of reply by tweet which is very convenient and easy for the user to do.</p>\n",

The most common model for water diffusion in tissue is the diffusion tensor (DT), which assumes a Gaussian distribution. This assumption of Gaussian diffusion oversimplifies the diffusive behavior of water in complex media, and is known experimentally to break down for relatively large b-values. DT derived indices, such as mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy, can correlate with major tissue damage, but lack sensitivity and specificity to subtle pathological changes. \nMicrostructure Imaging of Crossing (MIX) is versatile and thus suitable to a broad range of generic multicompartment models, in particular for brain areas where axonal pathways cross.</p>\n<p>Multicompartment models (assess the variability of diffusion in sub-voxel regions) enable the estimation of more specific indices and so potentially give much greater insight into tissue architecture.</p>\n<p>Goal of Model Fitting: Identify which model compartments are essential to explain the data and parameters that are potentially estimable from a particular experiment and compare the models to each other using the BIC.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>DIPY is an open source software mainly focusing on diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) analysis. For nonrigid image registration, it implements a Symmetric Normalization framework. The major goal of this framework is to calculate an affine or deffeomorphic transformation to register two 2D images or 3D volumes. As a well-known problem, registration is a non-convex optimization problem. It is very important to initialize as close to the solution as possible. So in order to avoid getting stuck at local optima, it uses a multi-resolution strategy by building a Gaussian Pyramid. That is to say we can register our images in as many stages as we want, providing previous results as initialization for the next. As this way, we need to do a lot of iterations, thus it slow down the optimization process.\n    To speed up the calculation, one solution is to convert to a parallel computing algorithm. The OpenMP API supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran. So in this project, I will implement a multi-thread algorithm using OpenMP to improve the performance of nonrigid image registration in DIPY.</p>\n",

They are determined by a Lévy seed and trawl function, which can be viewed as a news impact curve. The major advantage is that the marginal distribution can be modelled separate from the trawl function, allowing for a very flexible modelling of the autocorrelation structure exhibiting short or long memory. This class of processes has recently been applied in high frequency econometrics where it is used to describe the behaviour of financial spreads and price processes at ultra high frequencies.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is no open source code available to replicate any of the recent academic research. Similarly, practitioners wishing to apply these methods have no dependable source code to rely on. This project aims to change this by building a coherent simulation and estimation framework for both univariate and multivariate trawl processes. With this R package, users can apply the novel methodology to any application of interest, without having to worry about implementing the methods first.

In this project, we aim to add an state-of-the-art approach to the R packages for analyzing treatment effects changing over time at individual levels based on the observed EHR time series. The current R packages have limitations of using simple methods like linear models or propensity score matching to estimate average treatment effects in the population or at subgroup levels, which ignores the heterogeneity in the large observed data. Besides, these packages only focus on point-in-time estimates. We fill in the gap and provide a more comprehensive Bayesian nonparametric method for analyzing individual treatment effects on modern EHR data that are usually irregularly sampled time sequences and exposed to treatments multiple times.</p>\n",

As of now, RobStatTM is only available to R command line users, resulting in a steep learning curve for effective use of the robust methods outlined in RSTM and the RobStatTM package. We believe the inclusion of a UI will allow for a more intuitive approach to understanding robust methods and, thus, lead to a more widespread and effective use of the RobStatTM package in both university courses where these methods are applicable and among practicing statisticians and financial professionals, the latter of which uses R extensively.</p>\n",

As per today, no work has been done now which includes multimodality into account (especially audio ) to determine the kind of activities and scenes that person is involved when it comes to egocentric perception. I have already built an audio-based model based on popular IEEE-DCASE-challenge which can successfully classify scenes into categories like ( person is walking in a park, driving in a car ) for egocentric views. I plan to extend my work as part of gsoc-2k18 to incorporate my model with video-based models and increase the scope of model from scenes to scenes+activities. The final breakdown of the steps is submitted in the pre-proposal attached above. The idea is to built pyscene-detect for egocentric videos,  which would be a prominent contribution owing to growing research in the area of first person view  videos.</p>\n",

I would like to propose a mechanism for users to act on the errors straight from the error page.

It should also be extendable by other gems for them to customize their own course of actions when an actionable error is hit.</p>\n<p>A Web Console integration will also be done to update the console style to fit the look and feel of the new redesign.</p>\n<p>In addition to these ideas, we can also attempt a series of opinionated rails generators that will create a suite of default error pages (404 and 500s for example), based on the new styling rules, or from a set of styles obtained from the application's implemented stylesheets.</p>\n",

Classically algebraic variety is defined as the set of solutions of polynomial equations over a number field. A rational point of an algebraic variety is a solution of set of equations in the given field (rational field if not mentioned). Much of the number theory can be viewed as the study of rational point of algebraic varieties. Some of the great achievements of number theory amount to determining the rational points on particular curves.\nFor example, Fermat’s last theorem is equivalent to the statement that for an integer n ≥ 3, the only rational point of the curve xn+yn=zn in P2 over Qare the obvious ones.  Common variants of these question include determining the set of all points of V(K) of height up to some bound. The aim of this project is to implement some basic rational point finding algorithms (sieving modulo prime and Doyle Krumm Algorithm) and extend these to product_projective_space scheme.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>TCP BBR was proposed as a modern TCP congestion control algorithm by Google in 2016. The traditional loss-based TCP algorithms like TCP CUBIC, reduce their sending rates greatly when detecting packet loss, and increase rates conservatively when no packets loss happens. However, it is hard to estimate the network condition just on basis of one metric, i.e, packet loss. As a consequence, loss-based TCP algorithms underutilize network during most of the time, but cause severe congestion occasionally.</p>\n<p>TCP BBR is a new variation of TCP algorithm which adjusts its sending rate based on the real-time network metric, i.e, packet round trip time (RTT), the delivered rate (goodput). It is optimal that the amount of traffic walking through a network link is just equal to the well-known bandwidth delay production (BDP). Hence, TCP BBR uses RTT and goodput to constrict the amount of traffic in flight is equal to BDP. In this way, TCP BBR can maximize the goodput, and minimize the RTT at the same time.</p>\n<p>As a high-performance network stack, it is very important for Seastar to provide such high-performance TCP algorithm to further upgrade the performance.</p>\n",

In the past, this data has been classified using a formula based on elevation angle, which is not always reliably available, or using another formula based on doppler velocity and spectral width which is biased to miscategorize low-velocity ionospheric backscatter (IS) as ground scatter (GS). Recently, researchers successfully applied machine learning techniques to this data. These approaches improved on past methods, but they used a very limited set of features and relied on simple machine learning methods that do not easily capture non-linear relationships or subtle probability distributions. This project applies machine learning methods with a focus on using a larger number of well-selected features and using more nuanced algorithms. The resulting Github toolkit provides combinations of DBSCAN and GMM for classifying SuperDARN data, along with various plotting tools. This project will continue after the summer, and I plan to add details on validation and try new algorithms.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Primero1 will be a free web app, designed basically for kids aged 4-7 to enhance their learning abilities in a fun, creative and natural way. This app will be a smaller version of Sugarizer. The app will be targeted towards Pre-k1 and Pre-k2 grade curriculum. The app will be focusing on kids who are non-readers and who are in the phase of developing their thinking, learning and collaborating abilities. The app will be made colorful so that it is fun &amp; enjoyable for the kids. Sugarizer activities will include things like, learning about music, drawing shapes and learning basic mathematical concepts through games like Cuisenaire rods. Existing educational apps available online are too difficult for kids &amp; the smallness of the icons of existing apps makes it difficult for the kids to play. Hence, our application can address these shortcomings. The goal of Primero1 is to allow kids to use Sugarizer as a powerful learning tool. We will ensure that the graphics used in the user interface are bright and of a suitable size, so that it can attract kids attention.</p>\n",

Thus, even developers identify a critical bug in the contract it is not possible to push a bugfix in a straightforward way. Thus, in order to fill the gap of not having a proper 'smart contract' compatible monitoring service, SCoRE has propose to build a web application that can monitor other smart contracts in Ethereum and give the capability to safeguard it's critical functions (Ether send and receive) and interact and visualize with smart contract functions in a much simpler way.</p>\n<p>For the analysis, Etherbeat has a blockchain extractor, which is currently implemented using python with 4 parallel processing threads.</p>\n",

The SymPy mechanics module now has enough power and functionality to be a fully featured symbolic dynamics module. The PyDy package extends the SymPy output to the numerical domain for simulation, analyses, and visualization.\nThis project is about creating a parser that would translate Autolev code to SymPy code using the ANTLR framework. This would help users of Autolev to familiarize themselves with SymPy Mechanics. The project will also involve writing a lot of tests and documentation examples to demonstrate the functionality of the parser.</p>\n",

Currently <code>solveset</code> is unable to handle such equations, therefore, to make <code>solveset</code> powerful and versatile <code>transolve</code> needs to be implemented. <code>transolve</code> will mainly cover equations like logarithmic, exponential, equations solvable by LambertW and trigonometric.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The relevance of ARM processors is rising. Especially since ARM recently started targeting the servers and desktop market, thus going beyond the mobile devices. That’s why malware targeting ARM is becoming an even bigger threat every day. On the other hand, it is still the x86 architecture for which most reverse engineering tools are developed. This Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project aims to add ARM support for both the dynamic analysis framework DRAKVUF and the virtual machine introspection (VMI) library libvmi. The idea is to base our project upon the result of an earlier GSoC project which added altp2m support for Xen on ARM. The altp2m subsystem defines different views on the guest’s physical memory and allows to dynamically switch among them. With altp2m and DRAKVUF we are able to build a stealthy VMI framework. In summary, the goal of the GSoC project is to add support for DRAKVUF for ARM and thus provide more options for reverse engineering on the ARM architecture.</p>\n",

We try to fix programs with pre-condition and post-condition written in separation logic. Given a program, we first run JSF to collect its post-state(p) by symbolic execution with the given pre-condition. Then we check if p entails the given post-condition(p'). If not, a bug is detected. Our approach to program repair has two main components: abduction and repair specification inference. First, we propose to infer the missing information to establish the post-condition through abduction using an existing solver. In particular, we infer a constraint f such that p * f is satisfied and p * f |-&gt; p'. Secondly, based on abduction, we symbolically execute the input program with the abduction in a backward manner in order to construct repair specifications at every line of the input program. These repair specifications help to infer valid Hoare-style triples with fix candidates.</p>\n",

Some of the promising new solutions rely on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) (RFC 3168) to notify TCP endpoints of congestion that may be developing in a bottleneck queue, without resorting to packet drops. As a result, there have been attempts at Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to extend the functionality of ECN and provide rich feedback to TCP endpoints. In this regard, Accurate ECN feedback (AccECN) and ECN++ are two active topics of discussion at IETF.

But net-next-nuse has not kept pace with latest versions of Linux kernel. This has been the major hindrance for DCE to use latest Linux kernel. An active alternative to LibOs is Linux Kernel Library (LKL), which provides similar features of LibOs and supports latest Linux kernel versions. In this project, LibOs will be replaced with LKL from DCE to support the networking stack of Linux. Currently, DCE uses custom implementation of libc; this makes it hard to maintain the code base.

This is achieved by splitting the screen in half where one half contains the video lessons and the other half contains the simulations which the students can interact with while they watch the lesson.

The purpose of this project is to pick some more recent games that offer a benchmark mode and write scripts that configure, run the benchmark and read the results.

As one of the most powerful module bundlers in recent year, Webpack team endeavors to enhance the bundling performance. In the latest version of Webpack 4, several improvements like new plugin system and parallelization with cache with UglifyJs have been implemented and accomplish a considerable performance enhancement. In this project, some cores and dependencies of Webpack are re-implemented in Rust, a low-level language, and WebAssembly binary is generated from them with the corresponding compilers. Some automation tools are used to help to convert existing JavaScript sources as well as future works to other languages. At the same time, backward compatibility of earlier Node.js versions will be maintained. It can be considered to be a significant performance enhancement with this project in the future Webpack release.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>All the GPU drivers have a scheduler component that schedules the job received from the applications on the GPU hardware. Recently the amdgpu’s (AMD’s graphics driver) scheduler was shifted to a common space (now called DRM GPU scheduler) so that the other drivers can reuse the code. The GPU scheduler is now used by amdgpu and etnaviv (graphics driver for Vivante GPUs). It provides entities which allow userspace to push jobs into queues which are then executed by a hardware run queue. Now amdgpu has multiple identical hardware queues and we currently map round robin to the software queues provided by the GPU scheduler when those are created. To better balance the load we could extend the scheduler to feed multiple hardware queues from just one software queue provided by the GPU scheduler.</p>\n",

Create a Virtual KMS (VKMS) has benefits. First, it could be used for testing; second, it can be valuable for running X or Wayland on a headless machine enabling the use of GPU. This module is similar to VGEM, and in some ways to VIRTIO. At the moment that VKMS gets mature enough, it will be used to run i-g-t test cases and to automate userspace testing.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>My proposal is focused on making certain improvements in Zulip that are considered prioritary, with the goal of providing high-value contributions in consonance with the project's roadmap.</p>\n<p>Most of Zulip's REST API is currently undocumented, which is a pity considering how powerful it is. The first project in my proposal is to solve this by working in our <strong>Swagger/OpenAPI docs</strong> until we have a 100% documented REST API. The relevant code examples will also be updated so we can provide fully functional scripts that show how to use it, as well as extending our Python bindings to cover all the endpoints the API provides.</p>\n<p>The role that API keys play is also quite important, especially now that our integrations system is becoming more and more robust and we have many different clients for interacting with Zulip.\nThat's why having <strong>multiple API keys per user</strong> could be very useful in terms of user account security and convenience. The second part of my project consists in implementing this feature in Zulip's backend, so normal users can have as many API keys they consider necessary (e.g. one per client), keeping authentication tokens isolated between applications.</p>\n",

These communities may or may not be open source communities but still might desire that people on web should be able to access their communications without the need getting an account. With this project we want Zulip to become capable of serving chats that happened in public streams to anyone on the web. Essentially one will be able to read the chats of a web public stream. Members of such a stream will consent to terms of publishing their conversations online. Also this project will help search engines index public chats that happened on a Zulip server accessible to anyone on the web. This will greatly enhance the support available for debugging issues with Zulip installations since we can expect solutions provided on Zulip developers chat to pop up in search results of a search engine query.</p>\n",
