While many academic models and institutional frameworks exist, open-source tools that replicate these methods — especially in R — are few and far between. This project aims to close that gap by contributing to the ExpectedReturns package, developing clean, modular functions that implement and generalize key factor construction techniques inspired by Antti Ilmanen’s Investing Amid Low Expected Returns.\n\nThe focus will be on engineering reusable code for factors like value, momentum, profitability, and investment using raw or semi-structured financial data. These will be built using lightweight, testable components supported by packages like FactorAnalytics, PerformanceAnalytics, and tinytest, while following conventions used by Chen, Zimmermann, and Kelly. Also included will be vignettes and documentation that show how to reproduce these concepts in practice — making the tools both transparent and portable. This will be a two-month project.\n\nDeliverables will include:\n– Core functions for factor construction and data prep\n– Lightweight unit tests and clean vignettes\n– Documentation of inputs, outputs, and assumptions\n– A reproducible build setup that works across systems\n\nThe goal is to make these concepts accessible — not just for researchers, but for anyone trying to understand and apply factor models in real-world contexts. If successful, this project will leave behind a set of tools that are as useful to the open-source community as they are to academic replication.",

          "description": "Researchers have tremendous difficulty keeping up with the exponential growth of scientific literature, hindering their ability to stay on top of the latest insights in their field. This is especially true in quantum physics, where groundbreaking findings and complex concepts are emerging at a rapid pace, demanding constant attention and analysis from researchers. There is a dire need for AI that can efficiently process and summarize these vast volumes of scientific papers, helping human researchers focus their efforts on the most promising areas of investigation.\n\nThe problem of knowledge overload and the need for efficient systems to navigate and synthesize vast amounts of literature is not unique to quantum physics. In fact, it is a pervasive challenge across various academic and scientific disciplines, including statistics and data science – the very fields that led to the development of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models.\n\nThe exponential growth of research papers, coupled with the rapid advancement of statistical methodologies and data-driven approaches, has created a significant knowledge bottleneck in these domains. Researchers and practitioners in statistics and data science often struggle to keep up with the latest developments, hindering their ability to effectively leverage cutting-edge techniques and methodologies in their work. This knowledge overload problem has motivated the development of AI-powered systems like LLMs and RAG models, which aim to streamline the process of knowledge discovery, synthesis, and dissemination.\n\nBy adapting the proposed \"AI Scholar\" system to the domains of statistics and data science, researchers in these fields could benefit from personalized recommendations, automated literature analysis, and idea generation capabilities, ultimately accelerating the pace of innovation and fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration.",

The current pure R implementation faces significant scaling challenges with larger datasets.

          "description": "Stochastic dynamical systems play an important role in scientific and engineering domains, particularly in systems governed by Brownian motion or subject to random perturbations from the environment. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) provide a mathematical framework to describe such complex stochastic behaviour. Understanding the hidden physics within these systems is pretty much essential for analyzing their stochastic and nonlinear dynamics.\n\nThe NeuralPDE package in the SciML ecosystem currently lacks documentation for its existing SDE Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) solver and does not yet support multidimensional SDEs and SPDEs. This project aims to document the existing solver while also extending it to include PINN solvers for multidimensional SDEs based on the Wiener expansion, which expresses stochastic solutions as spectral expansions in terms of a set of random basis functions. The proposed SDE PINN solver uses the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève (KKL) expansion for the Wiener process to obtain finite-dimensional approximations, effectively transforming SDEs into rough path ODEs. These ODEs can then be solved using the standard loss function formulation of PINNs for ODEs.\n\nAs a natural extension, this approach can be generalized to SPDEs using the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), which extends the Wiener expansion to handle spatially distributed noise in stochastic systems. By developing and implementing these solvers, this project aims to enhance NeuralPDE's capabilities in solving high-dimensional stochastic systems, making it a more comprehensive tool for data-driven modelling and simulation of stochastic dynamical systems.",

This functionality is essential for integrating data from various sources and experiments — especially with the growing popularity of multi-omics approaches and the increasing availability of public datasets. Existing solutions, such as HiCLift, offer partial support but often fail to provide an optimal balance between accuracy and performance, particularly in cases of partial bin mismatches or complex remapping scenarios.\n\nLiftOver2D seeks to overcome these limitations by leveraging background contact distributions at the bin level, allowing for more precise and efficient remapping. The main goal is to design a method that achieves an acceptable trade-off between accuracy and speed, ensuring the tool is practical for real-world bioinformatics pipelines without sacrificing data quality or runtime efficiency. During the project, we plan to develop a custom model for bin-level remapping and optimal bin-to-bin matching across genome assemblies, and test our tool on various experiments and organisms using publicly available data from open databases (such as NCBI GEO). We aim to maximize performance and parallelization using both high-level data frameworks (like Dask or Polars) and lower-level languages where appropriate. The resulting algorithm will be wrapped into convenient packages for Python, R, and the command line. We also plan to collaborate with major tools in the Hi-C ecosystem (such as Cooler or Muon for multimodal experiments) to integrate our functionality into widely-used frameworks.\n\nIn the long term, LiftOver2D aspires to become a community-standard solution for fast remapping of 2D genomic contact data.

          "description": "Intel™’s Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is an industry standard specification that revolutionized power management by putting it in the hands of the operating system, rather than the BIOS. As it currently stands, it is widely available across 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, with specially tailored manuals towards Windows™ and UNIX. \n\nFreeBSD has implemented ACPI, utilizing Intel™’s ACPI Computer Architecture (ACPICA). The major contention point is that it is outside the loader. In this state, it is inefficient; information that’s only available to ACPI, is therefore unavailable to the boot loader. As such, the boot loader essentially has to guess what that information is, and is often wrong. This proposal aims to alleviate this bottleneck by bringing a lightweight version of ACPICA into the loader. With this integration, ACPI will not only be more efficiently managed, but it will also be script-able with Lua, providing FreeBSD users ease of configuration.\n\nDeliverables include: (1) stand/efi/acpica/Osd/ with necessary ACPICA/AML initialization, (2) stand/efi/loader/arch/$ARCH for arm64 and amd64 specific glue code, (3) complete integration of both architectures: ACPI initialized in the loader, (4) the ACPI namespace enumerated in C, (5) an ACPI API layer, (6) Lua bindings, and (7) updated FreeBSD ACPI handbook and man pages.",

Key deliverables include integrated code for detecting, parsing, and managing journal data, functional logging of metadata changes within transactions, a complete implementation for committing these transactions to the on-disk journal, integration of journaling across major metadata operations, support for at least one standard journaling mode (like data=ordered or data=writeback), and comprehensive test cases accompanied by thorough documentation.",

This makes identifying power-hungry processes challenging, hindering energy efficiency on laptops and servers. To address this, I propose developing a lightweight, FreeBSD-native power profiling tool inspired by Linux’s PowerTOP, prioritizing simplicity and integration with FreeBSD’s architecture.  \n\nThe solution comprises:  \n1. Kernel Module: A RAPL driver to collect CPU power data (Intel/AMD) via `/dev/cpuctl`, leveraging existing FreeBSD code.  \n2. Monitoring Daemon: A background service to aggregate metrics, correlate process activity (using `pmc(3)`), and maintain historical logs.  \n3. User Tools: A CLI utility for real-time process-level analysis and Grafana integration for visualization. Additional support for the `amd_s2idle.py` script will aid suspend/resume diagnostics.  \n\nDeliverables include the kernel module, daemon, CLI tool, validation tests, and documentation. This approach avoids the complexity of modular frameworks like PCP, ensuring low overhead and maintainability.  \n\nThe tool will empower users to optimize energy use, extend battery life, and reduce server costs. Future extensions could support GPU monitoring or predictive analytics.

          "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, leading to their widespread adoption. However, they still require significant computational resources for inference, especially when deployed on hardware-constrained devices. While the Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) helps reduce memory and compute requirements through quantization and weight compression, further efficient execution of these compressed models remains a challenge due to kernel-level inefficiencies. In particular, low-bit matrix multiplications (matmul) introduce unwanted overhead, often involving multiple separate kernels for operations like dequantization, bit packing, matmul, etc. Additionally, multiple kernels are required to accommodate different scenarios such as single (GEMV) or batched (GEMM and GEMM Split-K) prefills and token decoding in LLMs, adding another layer of complexity. This project aims to accelerate inference of NNCF-compressed LLMs by implementing optimized, fused low-bit matmul kernels using Triton. Existing open-source low-bit kernel implementations (e.g., GemLite, Tinygemm, etc.) will be evaluated, and the most suitable will be adapted and integrated into NNCF. These custom kernels will support available quantization formats (INT8, INT4, etc.), and will be wrapped using custom_op to ensure compatibility with PyTorch’s torch.compile. It will include performance benchmarking and profiling on NVIDIA and Intel GPUs, submission of a pull request to NNCF with the implemented changes, and comprehensive blog posts/documentation.",

The pipeline will include data preprocessing, semantic matching, low-confidence flagging, and expert validation. A user-friendly UI will allow curators to review and confirm mappings, with final results stored in cBioPortal’s backend database.\n\nKey deliverables include:\n\n-A fully functional metadata harmonization pipeline\n-Semantic similarity models fine-tuned on curated biomedical data\n-Integration with cBioPortal's existing infrastructure\n-An interactive UI for expert review and export\n-Documentation and testing coverage\n\nThis tool will reduce manual curation time by over 70%, improve metadata consistency, and enhance the platform’s readiness for AI-driven research.",

The goal of cBioPortal is to significantly lower the barriers between complex genomic data and cancer researchers by providing rapid, intuitive, and high-quality access to molecular profiles and clinical attributes from large-scale cancer genomics projects.\nCurrently, a Structural Variants tab is present in the cBioPortal results view page reporting structural variants in a tabular format without any visual representation. However, structural variants mainly consist of large and complex chromosome rearrangements that overlap with other mutational data and need to be carefully checked in relation to other metrics, such as depth of coverage and mutational density. Therefore, the lack of a comprehensive visualization tool that is able to display the whole mutational landscape in one genomic region has become a pressing issue.\nThis project aims to fill this gap by enriching multiple cBioPortal tabs with interactive plots where the user will be able to dive into these intricate genomic aberrations.

          "description": "My project aims to enhance cBioportal's analytical capabilities by integrating Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) visualization into the Plots Tab and OncoPrint views. Currently, in Plots Tab we can visualize mutation types of particular gene across different cancer types but it is not possible to visualize VAF data for different samples across different cancer types. It is very crucial for researchers to understand mutation clonality and prevalence across cohorts through VAF. Similarly in OncoPrint view we cannot add tracks for VAF heatmaps across different genes. The proposed solution has two components. For the Plots Tab, we will introduce VAF (linked to a specific gene) as a selectable numerical data type of mutation for plot axes. This involves modifying the axis data generation logic  to calculate VAF per sample using, appropriately handling cases with multiple or no mutations. Existing plot components will then automatically render Box-Scatter or Scatter plots. For OncoPrint, we will implement gene-specific VAF heatmap tracks displayed below the main alteration grid. A new UI element within the Tracks menu toolbar will enable users to add VAF tracks for selected genes. This action updates URL parameters, triggering a new data fetching utility which retrieves VAF heatmaps corresponding to primary displayed mutations with a dedicated 0-1 color scale. OncoprintJS library  will render these heatmap tracks, complemented by tooltips showing detailed VAF information on hover.",

Using learnable rotation matrices conditioned on class labels or contextual information, this study aims to create a novel generative model that learns and applies rotational symmetry transformations to CMS data.  Our goal is to find and utilize rotational symmetries by including this model into a GAN-like framework with a trained classifier. This will enhance data augmentation and model performance in semi-supervised CMS data processing.",

          "description": "In high-energy physics (HEP), automating the symbolic computation of squared amplitudes is essential for predicting cross-sections and validating theoretical models against experimental data. Current transformer-based approaches excel in sequence modeling but falter in capturing the relational structures and physical consistency required for HEP expressions, such as those involving gamma matrices and Mandelstam variables. To tackle this, I propose the Physics-Informed Performer (PIP), a novel framework that integrates the Performer transformer’s efficient kernel-based attention with a physics-informed tokenization scheme and a SymPy-based validation layer. This approach leverages Performer’s ability to handle long sequences, introduces tokens like <SQUARE> and <S> to embed HEP-specific operations and kinematics, and ensures symbolic accuracy through empirical post-processing. By focusing on data representation, PIP offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional symbolic methods, tailored to the Task 1.2 dataset of amplitude-to-squared-amplitude mappings.",

Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. While the calculation of amplitudes for a particular expression is trivial, mapping it to a squared amplitude is computationally expensive. Previous works demonstrated that transformer-based (vanilla and KAN-infused) models can map amplitudes to squared amplitudes substantially faster and with high accuracy. However, transformers suffer from quadratic complexity due to self-attention, making them less efficient when handling extremely long sequences. Additionally, they may struggle with structured, hierarchical dependencies that naturally arise in amplitude computations. Inspired by Classical State Space theory, State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modelling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of RNNs and CNNs. These models have near-linear scaling with sequence length, making them effective for long-range dependencies.

We will build a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline to extract features from transmission spectra, classify atmospheric compositions, and detect anomalies that could signal unique or potentially habitable planetary conditions. Using both simulated spectra (via petitRADTRANS and Poseidon) and real observational data (from JWST/Hubble), we will benchmark QML models against classical approaches. The final deliverables include QML-based tools for spectral analysis, comprehensive performance evaluations, and detailed documentation to support future exoplanet exploration efforts.",

This work presents a hybrid\nself-supervised framework that leverages physics-informed deep learning to ad-\ndress these challenges. Our approach utilizes a masked transformer encoder to\nlearn conservation of momentum and energy by reconstructing masked particle\nfeatures, while a Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr)\nencodes the space-time symmetries present in collision events. By integrating\nthese complementary embeddings into task-specific cross-attention decoders, the\nframework effectively fuses physical and geometric information to enhance event\nclassification and mass reconstruction, thereby advancing the performance and\ninterpretability of machine learning in high-energy physics.",

The file system will support basic operations such as file creation and deletion, without requiring recursive directory structures.

          "description": "OCSMesh is a Python package designed for generating unstructured meshes tailored to ocean modeling. However, its current workflow, particularly the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) processing and JIGSAW mesh generation steps, remains highly time-consuming and not well-optimized for High Performance Computing (HPC) environments.\nTo address this bottleneck, I propose introducing parallelism into the most computationally intensive stages of the workflow: DEM processing and JIGSAW-based meshing. My approach involves leveraging parallel computing libraries such as Dask and mpi4py to scale these operations across multiple cores and nodes.\nFor the preprocessing stage, several components are already optimized for single-node performance and can be extended to work efficiently in an HPC setting. Regarding JIGSAW meshing, I plan to implement a domain decomposition strategy, partitioning the domain into smaller subdomains that can be meshed independently in parallel. These subdomain meshes will then be seamlessly merged to form the final unified mesh.\nThis parallelized workflow is expected to dramatically reduce mesh generation time, enabling more scalable and efficient processing for large-scale ocean modeling tasks. I aim to integrate mpi4py support into the key functions across the codebase, while using Dask specifically for raster windowing and DEM data handling.",

These polyglot projects currently lack fuzz testing, making them prone to undetected bugs and security issues. This project proposes integrating such polyglot OpenPrinting projects, namely ipp-usb, goipp, pycups, and pyppd, into OSS-Fuzz to enable continuous, large-scale fuzzing. The work will include evaluating current unit tests, improving coverage where lacking, identifying suitable fuzzing targets based on test coverage and risk, developing fuzz harnesses, and integrating the projects into OSS-Fuzz. This effort will help expand OSS-Fuzz coverage across OpenPrinting projects, further strengthening their overall security and reliability.",

These parameters cannot be measured directly and must be inferred from signal progression over time in techniques such as Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). The estimation is complicated by measurement noise, model ambiguity, and the sensitivity of parameter estimates to small variations in the data.\nTo improve robustness and accuracy, this project will implement a Bayesian framework that incorporates prior physiological knowledge and observed MRI signals to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters. For the pharmacokinetic modeling the Tofts model for DCE-MRI and perfusion modeling for ASL will be used. Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling and gradient-based optimization methods may improve the robustness of the reconstruction.\n\n\nDeliverables include:\n    – An extensible implementation of the BBB modeling pipeline using OSIPI tools\n    – Support for both DCE-MRI and ASL data,\n    – Parameter estimation via Bayesian inference and optimization,\n    – Comprehensive documentation and integration into the OSIPI project.",

The focus is on improving Watchdog, a Go-based backend service that tracks the health and data integrity of OBA servers by reporting detailed metrics to Prometheus.\n\nIn the past, a Python script was used to monitor the system by checking real-time API data and identifying issues such as expired transit bundles or data mismatches. However, this legacy solution lacked flexibility and scalability. The current Watchdog framework, built in Go, addresses these shortcomings but still requires the addition of several key metrics.\n\nThe proposed solution builds on the existing Go codebase, expanding and refining the metrics to ensure accurate, real-time tracking of issues such as unmatched trips, stale data, and anomalies in transit information. The project also prioritizes maintainability by refactoring code, implementing robust error reporting through Sentry, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage to maintain reliability.\n\nKey deliverables include:\n\nImplementation of multiple high-priority metrics\n\nComplete test coverage and improved modularity of the codebase\n\nClear, user-friendly documentation\n\nA production-ready, extensible monitoring service for OBA\n\nThis work will provide transit agencies with better insights into data health and system performance, ultimately enhancing the experience for thousands of daily riders.",

The implementation will follow iOS design patterns while ensuring feature parity with Android.\n\nKey components include:\n- Contextual survey cards that appear at relevant moments\n- Multi-question survey forms using Eureka\n- External survey support with context data passing\n- Core Data integration for survey state management\n- Network services for fetching surveys and submitting responses\n- User preferences for survey participation\n\nMy previous contributions to OneBusAway iOS and experience with Swift development have prepared me for this project. The proposed implementation follows MVVM architecture and emphasizes accessibility, with full VoiceOver support and Dynamic Type integration.\n\nBy bringing this feature to iOS, we'll help transit agencies collect essential feedback to improve service quality, with particular focus on understanding women's unique transit experiences, mobility of care trips, and complex travel patterns.",

This new design will be introduced to enhance usability, responsiveness, and overall user experience. The goal is to create a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing interface that improves workflow efficiency for users interacting with contract templates.",

This means organizing the codebase using the standard way Joomla! 5 builds things.\n\nSecond, I want to make sure Weblinks is really reliable. To do this, I'll be writing a lot of automated tests using Cypress. These tests will check if everything is working correctly, so we can catch and fix problems easily. I'm aiming for really good test coverage – checking almost everything important.\n\nThird, I'll be looking at the list of problems people have reported with Weblinks and trying to fix them. This will make the tool much better for everyone who uses it.\n\nFinally, I'll be updating the instructions and explanations (the documentation) for Weblinks. This will help people understand how to use it and help other programmers contribute to it in the future.\n\nI've planned out how I'll do all this over the summer, step by step. I'll start by working on the main parts of the tool, then add the tests, fix the problems, and update the instructions. If I have time at the end, I might even try to add a new feature to help manage how weblinks are used.",

Traditional migration methods require custom tools for each CMS pair, leading to an O(n²) scalability problem.

Using Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), we will dynamically adapt to various CMS schemas and automate migration script generation.\n\nThe solution will be a Joomla component acting as a universal mediator to extract and transform content between CMSs. It can be installed on any Joomla instance, either directly or as a temporary migration app to handle API-based content migration between any CMSs.\n\nThis project reduces development overhead, enables reusable migration structure, and positions Joomla as a central hub for content exchange across platforms.\n\nDeliverables:\n* CCM Joomla Component: A standalone migration component built for Joomla.\n* WordPress-to-Joomla Migration: Real implementation example using the CCM.\n* Testing Suite: Unit, integration, and E2E tests to ensure migration reliability.\n* Documentation: Clear guides for extending to other CMSs.",

          "description": "SymPy currently lacks an efficient backend for dense and sparse multivariate polynomials over ℤ and ℚ, leading to performance bottlenecks in many core functions such as solve, linsolve, simplify, cancel, and polynomial GCD computations. This project aims to address this by integrating FLINT’s highly optimized multivariate polynomial arithmetic into SymPy via python-flint. To achieve this, we will implement: FLINT-backed Sparse Polynomial Support – FlintPolyRing (FLINT-backed equivalent of PolyRing), FlintPolyElement (FLINT-backed equivalent of PolyElement), comprehensive tests and documentation. FLINT-backed Dense Polynomial Support – DMP_Flint (FLINT-backed dense multivariate polynomial class), comprehensive tests and documentation. Performance Analysis and Optimization – Benchmarking against SymPy’s existing implementations, optimizing operations. This is a high-priority task in SymPy's development roadmap, and achieving this can make SymPy reach \"state-of-the-art\" levels of speed and performance. Since multivariate polynomial operations are involved across various modules in SymPy, this project significantly strengthens the library.",

          "description": "This GSoC project focuses on strengthening SymPy's assumptions system through a two-fold approach. The first component targets relational reasoning by addressing key inference gaps, without needing explicit real assumptions. Additionally, it involves integrating an incremental SAT solver to significantly improve the performance of ask and satask by enabling clause reuse across queries.\nThe second part of the project introduces support for quantified logical reasoning. By implementing universal and existential quantifiers (Q.forall, Q.exists), SymPy users will be able to express and evaluate rich, domain-spanning mathematical statements. This will be realized using a hybrid strategy, combining Z3-style pattern-based instantiation with SymPy's symbolic, declarative assumptions system.\nTogether, these enhancements aim to make SymPy's logic engine more expressive, efficient, and mathematically powerful.",

Current tools rely on numerical approximations for these wrapping paths, which require intensive computation. This project will extend SymPy’s mechanics module by introducing three new wrapping geometry classes: WrappingCone, WrappingEllipsoid, and WrappingToroid each providing symbolic geodesic-length calculations and endpoint tangent vectors. Using closed‑form derivations for cones, series expansions for spheroids, and local unfolding approximations for tori, the new classes will enable users to model complex biomechanical interactions symbolically, offering both exact expressions (where ever available) and good approximations.

These proofs, which will be integrated into continuous integration (CI), will not only check correctness for all executions within a bound but also verify memory safety, especially in areas mixing safe and unsafe Rust.\n\nCommunity Benefits:\n\n1. Increased trust in Rust vmm’s conformance to the VirtIO spec, benefiting all dependent projects.\n2.

The new setup will use a Java-based local installation that allows users to double-click and run OpenMRS, mariadb4j for an embedded- hassle-free database solution, docker Compose (only for CI/CD) to automate testing and deployment pipelines.\n\nBy the end of the project, OpenMRS will have a user-friendly, cross-platform installer, an embedded database, and an automated build process for multiple OpenMRS versions (2.x, 3.x, and Core Platform 2.7.x+).",

          "description": "OpenMRS currently utilizes Hibernate Envers to track database changes, offering robust audit capabilities. However, the system lacks a user-friendly way for administrators to view, filter, and interact with audit logs. This project proposes building a backend module that exposes audit log data in a meaningful way through a legacy UI-based audit log viewer, REST endpoints for external access, and an extension that tracks read operations on selected entities—something Envers does not support out-of-the-box.\n\nThe solution will include:\n\n1. Audit log retrieval and visualization within the legacy UI\n\n2. Custom tracking of read operations using Hibernate event listeners or an alternative approach\n\n3. Filtering capabilities (by user, date, and entity)\n\n4. RESTful APIs for external access to audit data\n\n5. A well-documented architecture, extensible to other OpenMRS modules\n\nBy the end of this project, OpenMRS administrators will have a comprehensive and usable interface to audit system activity, improving transparency, traceability, and compliance with healthcare data standards.",

To overcome this, the project proposes reimplementing I/O APIs specifically Unix sockets, datagram sockets, and processes by leveraging polling-based mechanisms introduced in Cats Effect v3.6.0, which will remove the reliance on dedicated dispatcher threads and eliminate inefficiencies tied to blocking calls. This reimplementation will support JVM selector-based polling and Native file descriptor polling, while keeping existing implementations as fallbacks for runtimes that do not support the new approach therefore ensuring backward compatibility. The project will deliver these reimplemented APIs alongside comprehensive test suites to verify correctness, performance benchmarks to quantify improvements, and updated API documentation to ensure usability. By improving FS2’s efficiency and scalability, this enhancement will strengthen the Typelevel ecosystem and provide high-performance streaming library tailored for modern applications.",

          "description": "Cancer has become one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. One of the critical drawbacks of current cancer treatment has been the lack of target selectivity, as the drug effects should be exclusively on cancer cells without affecting healthy cells. In addition, their mechanism of action should be rapid enough to prevent the spread of cancer cells to adjacent healthy cells. The use of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and other traditional therapies, such as surgery and radiotherapy, leads to off-target interactions with serious side effects. Also, traditional drug modalities, such as small-molecule drugs and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), act upon either blocking specific pathways or inhibiting certain enzymes. Therefore, the need to overcome this limitation has driven the development of novel drug modalities like Antibody-drug conjugates, protacs, and oligonucleotides. In this respect, recently developed target-selective Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are more effective than traditional therapies, presumably due to their modular structures that combine many chemical properties simultaneously. ADCs are typically made up of three different units: a highly selective Monoclonal antibody (mAb) which is developed against a tumor-associated antigen, the payload (cytotoxic agent), and the linker. In this case, the latter should be stable enough during circulation, and allow the release of cytotoxic agents on target cells.",

          "description": "Since the rise of social media two decades ago, researchers have been eager to characterize its impact on society, particularly in the area of information diffusion. Yet, one major gap remains: its reach via television remains unmeasured. As a result, studying the mediated influence of social media has been an ongoing challenge for Social, Behavioral, & Economic (SBE) researchers. \n\nInternet Archive’s TV News Archive provides access to over 2.6 million U.S. news broadcasts dating back to 2009. We will use these TV news broadcasts to train object detection and image classification models. “SM LogoTrack” will focus on detecting social media platform logos, while “SM PostTrack” will detect social media post screenshots. \n\nBy developing robust visual detection models - \"SM LogoTrack\" and \"SM PostTrack\" our project will offer researchers and journalists new tools to systematically trace the flow of information from social media to television news. More importantly, this work directly contributes to the mission of the TV News Archive by enhancing the discoverability and analytical value of its vast video collections.",

          "description": "As RISC-V adoption continues to grow, verifying functional correctness across various implementations becomes increasingly challenging due to the variability in core designs and protocols. Traditional verification frameworks require significant adaptation for each new RISC-V core, which complicates testing and debugging. This project, COCO-RISC-V Test Bench (COCO-RVTB), solves this problem by creating a reusable and scalable testbench that leverages the RISC-V Formal Interface (RVFI) for detailed execution trace comparison between the Ibex core and a trusted golden reference, Spike. This ensures instruction-level validation and helps identify subtle bugs that traditional methods might miss.\n\nThe testbench will include a memory preloading mechanism for ELF binaries, ensuring that both Ibex and Spike begin from identical states. Stepwise synchronization will enforce lockstep execution, enabling real-time detection of discrepancies in program counter, register, or memory updates. A scoreboard-based RVFI packet comparison unit will automatically validate each instruction, improving trace-level accuracy.\n\nBuilt with PyUVM and Cocotb, this framework will be simulator-agnostic, allowing it to run across simulators like Verilator and ModelSim without relying on proprietary features. The testbench will feature a configurable, parameterized bus interface to support protocol diversity, enabling easy integration with different RISC-V cores and future extensions.\n\nKey deliverables include:\n- A scoreboard-based RVFI trace checker.\n- A YAML-configurable, protocol-agnostic bus interface.\n- Structured error logging for debugging and traceability.\n- A simulator-agnostic framework using PyUVM and Cocotb.\n\nBy solving the challenges of core-specific verification, this project provides a scalable, standardized, and accurate approach to RISC-V core validation.",

          "description": "The goal of this project is to parallelize the CGAL Tetrahedral Remeshing package using the Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library. This will significantly reduce the computational time required for remeshing large meshes, enabling faster and more efficient simulations. CGAL already provides some parallel implementations for some of its packages. While the primary focus is to parallelize the Remeshing package, a key objective is to lay the foundation for a generic parallelization framework for CGAL. Analogously to C++ STL's execution policies we would like to develop a framework that could, as future work, be extended to the rest of the library and allow to seamlessly change execution policies. The core of this proposal is a generic framework for the parallel execution of atomic operations using TBB in the remeshing package.",

          "description": "The goal of this project is to enhance the existing Dual Contouring (DC) method in CGAL by implementing manifold contouring methods. While the classical DC is a powerful isosurfacing method, it may produce non-nonmanifold surfaces, leading to topological inconsistencies and computational challenges. Manifold dual contouring methods overcome this issue by introducing manifold constraints to ensure the generation of 2-manifold surfaces.\n\nThe project will begin with a detailed study of existing literature, including Manifold Dual Contouring by Schaefer, Ju and Warren, and other related methods. Based on the research, we will determine an algorithm that combines the most robust aspects of these methods. The next phase is to review current DC implementations in CGAL  to identify gaps that require modifications, particularly in routines such as the Quadratic Error Function (QEF) minimization, octree traversal, and polygonalization. Lastly, additional features will be added, including manifold criterions like the Euler characteristic test, and the support for multiple vertices per cell.\n\nThe final deliverables will be a robust implementation of the enhanced DC method integrated into CGAL under the Isosurfacing subroutine. The implementation will adhere to CGAL’s existing coding conventions to ensure flexibility, consistency, and maintainability within the library. The documentation will include a test file under Isosurfacing 3/test/Isosurfacing 3, visualization of test cases under Isosurfacing/fig, and a theoretical background under Isosurfacing 3/doc/Isosurfacing 3/Isosurfacing 3.txt.",

          "description": "Weighted ensemble (WE) simulations enhance the exploration of a molecular system’s phase space by running numerous short, parallel simulations and selectively replicating trajectories that enter under-sampled regions. This approach improves sampling efficiency compared to traditional long, continuous simulations. However, a potential bottleneck arises from the need to analyze each iteration’s trajectories before starting the next round of simulations. Typically, this involves loading and processing trajectory data after each iteration, which can introduce significant delays due to disk I/O. To address this issue, my project focuses on integrating trajectory streaming into WESTPA using MDAnalysis. Instead of waiting for full trajectories to be written and reloaded for analysis, this implementation will enable real-time, on-the-fly analysis of simulation data as it is generated. By eliminating post-processing delays, this modification will streamline the weighted ensemble workflow.",

          "description": "ProLIF, a tool for identifying protein-molecule interactions in molecular dynamics trajectories, lacks a straightforward method for evaluating hydrogen bonds when only heavy atoms are present. Many users usually compare experimental and computational structures without explicit hydrogens, but the existing protonation tools are cumbersome and error-prone for beginner-level programming users. This proposal introduces an \"implicit hydrogen bond (H-bond) interaction method\" directly using heavy atom positions to detect H-bonds.  The goal is to strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy and increase ProLIF's usability. The method will leverage distance-based calculations with geometrical constraints, similar to Mol* and Chimera, and incorporate a confidence score based on AutoDock Vina's hydrogen bond term.  Standardizing residue names from various force fields (CHARMM, AMBER, GROMOS, OPLS-AA) and assigning their associated protonation/hybridization states will be crucial for the new \"Protein helper function” before the H-bond detection.  Lastly, I plan to use the PINDER and PLINDER datasets (protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, respectively) to validate the implicit H-bond interaction method by comparing the results from the standard H-bond method.",

Kotlin developers using Gradle rely on tools like Detekt and Ktlint to enforce code quality. While Detekt and Ktlint offer reporting in various formats like (HTML, SARIF), their current integration with IDEs can be fragmented, requiring developers to switch contexts and manually review findings, which disrupts the coding workflow and slows down their development process. This project aims to implement a unified and actionable code quality reporting system through the integration of the recently introduced Gradle new Problems API. This API provides structured and rich information about the problems happening during a build. The information provided can be used by different interfaces such as Gradle’s console output, build scans, or IDEs to communicate any issues. With this API integration and structured format of the generated report, developers can experience faster issue identification, streamline debugging, and have improved code maintainability.

By leveraging cocotb’s existing introspection capabilities, the tool will produce .pyi stub files describing the DUT’s interface – its hierarchy of modules and signals – in a statically typed fashion. These stubs will enable IDE features like auto-completion via VS Code’s Pylance and allow static type checkers such as mypy to catch errors in testbench code, significantly improving the hardware verification development experience​. The generated stubs will mirror the HDL design’s structure (with considerations for hierarchical vs. flat representations) and provide a structured abstraction of the DUT interface that can even be used for mocking or unit-testing components of the testbench. Initially, the stub generator will rely on runtime cocotb introspection only, but it will be designed with extensibility in mind, so that future enhancements (e.g., integrating a SystemVerilog language server like slang for richer type info) can be incorporated​. Over a 175-hour Google Summer of Code timeline, the project will deliver a working stub-generation utility, along with documentation, tests, and integration into the cocotb ecosystem, providing a concrete benefit to the open-source hardware verification community.",

The -pg compiler flag inserts mcount() calls that dynamically redirect to either a no-op stub (when disabled) or a full tracer (when enabled). The implementation includes dynamic redirection in mcount(), the core function tracer (ftrace_trace_function), and the extended function_graph tracer with entry/exit hooks (ftrace_graph_caller and return_to_handler).

These compressed traces will be used for post-silicon debug, profiling, and performance monitoring of complex RISC-V-based systems. The encoder \nwill optionally support multiple trace modes (delta/full address, implicit exception, implicit return, jump target caching) and will output compact trace packets via a configurable output sink (FIFO, memory, or debug port). Integration tasks include Vivado IPI block diagram design, driver development in C++ for trace co-simulation/emulation, and decoder support. \n\nThe encoder will provide a high-bandwidth trace interface capturing instruction-level context, configurable compression modes for efficient trace packet generation, and optional support for synchronization, interrupts/traps, and jump/branch prediction.\n \nThe deliverables include RTL implementation of trace encoder and interface module, integration into ZynqParrot’s hardware flow and Vivado design, validation with co-simulation along with in-lab FPGA deployment, and host software to decode and visualize traces using RISC-V ELF binaries. \n\nBy adding fine-grained program observability, this work enhances the debuggability of complex RISC-V designs running on an FPGA and improves ZynqParrot’s capabilities as a full-stack prototyping platform.",

          "description": "This project aims to integrate the Sloan sparse matrix ordering algorithm from the Boost Graph Library into pgRouting, enhancing its capabilities for graph optimization for both undirected and directed graphs. The Sloan algorithm generates optimal vertex ordering that reduces profile and bandwidth of graphs, significantly improving the efficiency of matrix operations in network analysis applications.\n\nWhile pgRouting includes several matrix manipulation algorithms, it lacks specific matrix ordering algorithms like Sloan ordering that are essential for optimizing sparse matrices in network analysis. Current workarounds require users to export data to external tools, breaking workflow continuity.\n\nI plan to develop a new function pgr_sloanOrdering() with complete integration, comprehensive error handling, and support for both directed and undirected graphs. The implementation will leverage the Boost Graph Library's existing algorithm with careful adaptation to pgRouting's architecture.\nThe project deliverables include a fully implemented Sloan ordering algorithm integration, comprehensive documentation and usage examples, an extensive test suite with performance benchmarks, and support for various graph types with configurable parameters.\n\nThis project will benefit the community by expanding pgRouting's graph analysis capabilities, particularly for applications in transportation networks, utility network management, and scientific computing where matrix ordering significantly impacts computational efficiency.",

These algorithms optimize graph structures for improved numerical solver performance in scientific computing and network analysis. The King Ordering Algorithm minimizes graph bandwidth by reordering vertex indices based on pseudo-degree, reducing adjacency gaps and enhancing sparse matrix computations. The Minimum Degree Ordering Algorithm reduces fill-in during Cholesky factorization by reordering matrix rows to minimize nonzero elements introduced during Gaussian elimination. By integrating these algorithms, pgRouting will offer more efficient preprocessing options, benefiting large-scale network analysis and pathfinding tasks.

The solution involves creating a specialized Thrust executor that extends HPX's CUDA executor capabilities, implementing automatic memory management for data transfers between host and device, and developing a dispatching mechanism that selects the appropriate backend (CPU or GPU) based on execution policies. Key technical components include a version-aware API layer to handle Thrust compatibility, exception handling that bridges Thrust/CUDA errors with HPX's error system, and template-based algorithm overloads that transparently route calls to Thrust implementations when GPU execution is requested. The implementation will proceed through four phases: establishing core infrastructure (executor, memory management), integrating fundamental algorithms (transform, reduce, sort), adding HPX execution policy support, and concluding with comprehensive testing and optimization. The resulting system will allow developers to write single code paths that automatically leverage GPU acceleration through Thrust when available, all while maintaining HPX's asynchronous execution model through future-based interfaces.",

By building a Python API (tentatively named hpx-pyapi), we will expose key HPX functionalities (like futures, asynchronous tasks, and parallel algorithms) through an intuitive Python interface. This will enable users to leverage multi-core and distributed computing capabilities of HPX from Python applications without needing to write C++ code (GSoC – The STE||AR Group). \r\n\r\nIn essence, the project ”Pythonizes” HPX: users can “import hpx” in Python and readily apply HPX’s concurrency features to speed up computations. The end product will be a pip-installable package with comprehensive documentation and examples, significantly lowering the barrier for Python users to exploit HPX’s performance advantages.",

It involves three main components: accepting polygonal input during floorplan setup, generating standard cell rows and routing tracks that follow the shape boundaries, and updating the pin placement logic to work with irregular outlines.\n\nBy enabling these capabilities, OpenROAD will become more flexible and suitable for real-world designs where blocks may need to fit together like puzzle pieces.

For example, within biology and ecology, recommendation systems help track a species behavior by suggesting research on migration patterns, and within e-commerce these systems are used to better a user's online experience. As such, recommendation systems are vital to systems today and is a important field of research.\n\nDespite widespread use, traditional sequential recommendation systems face limitations. They primarily on historical user interactions to predict future preferences however struggle to capture contextual dependencies and adapting to dynamic user behaviors. Similarly, existing models predefined embeddings which restrict the ability to adapt and generalize. As such these problems lead to reduced recommendation accuracy, typically for example in cold-start users.\n\nAs such, the LLMSeqRec proposal will lead to a more personalized recommendation by interpreting and augmenting sequences with semantic context.

However, its current implementation supports only basic evaluations for tabular data and lacks both privacy-aware assessments and the ability to handle unstructured data formats like images.\n\nThis project proposes to address these limitations in two structured phases. In Phase 1, I will enhance AIDRIN’s capabilities for tabular datasets by implementing essential privacy-preserving metrics—such as k-Anonymity, l-Diversity, t-Closeness, MM Risk Score, and Entropy-Based Disclosure Risk—alongside other key checks for class imbalance, feature correlation, and model evaluation. These assessments will be supported by intuitive visualizations to help users make informed decisions about data quality and compliance.\n\nIn Phase 2, I will extend AIDRIN to support image datasets by integrating pretrained vision models to generate semantic embeddings. These embeddings will enable readiness evaluations such as duplicate and outlier detection, class imbalance analysis, completeness checks, and fairness diagnostics (when label or attribute metadata is available). The goal is to replicate AIDRIN’s structured readiness evaluation pipeline for visual data in a modular and reusable manner.\n\nDeliverables include:\n\nPrivacy and imbalance metric suite for tabular data with visual summaries\nEmbedding-based readiness evaluation pipeline for image datasets\nIntegration with pretrained vision models (ViT, CLIP, DINOv2)\nCLI tool for executing and exporting assessment results\nDocumentation, testing, and demonstration notebooks\nBy the end of the program, AIDRIN will support robust and privacy-aware readiness assessments for both structured and unstructured datasets, helping researchers and practitioners build more transparent, reliable, and ethical AI systems.",

          "description": "This proposal aims to broaden the geographical scope and enhance the functionality of CarbonCast, a tool dedicated to forecasting and visualizing the carbon intensity of electrical grids. Presently servicing select regions including parts of the US, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Poland, and Queensland, Australia, this project proposes to extend coverage to additional global regions. The expansion will enable CarbonCast to offer more comprehensive and timely insights into carbon emissions worldwide. Other key enhancements will include the development of a web interface that improves the accessibility and visualization of carbon data, making it easier for users to interact with and derive meaningful insights from the information. This project will transform CarbonCast into a more globally inclusive tool, providing critical data that supports informed decisions on energy consumption and carbon emission reduction.",

It has a set of tools for documentation, code and model generation, event management, etc. which helps to easily build and maintain EDA. A template is a project that specifies the generation process output by using the AsyncAPI generator and is the main way developers can benefit from AsyncAPI tool generations. This project aims to extend AsyncAPI suite of community maintained, production ready templates by developing and maintaining a new fully functional Java + Quarkus template for generating asynchronous applications using AsyncAPI’s generator repository. Quarkus, known for its Kubernetes-native capabilities and fast startup times, is an ideal framework for building modern event-driven microservices. This project aims to simplify the development of asynchronous services in Java by generating code and documentation for developers looking to use EDAs in a cloud-native application. Furthermore, this template will be one of the first templates developed inside the AsyncAPI’s generator repository. Allowing developers to test changes locally in the generator repository, making the development easier and reducing the number of workarounds in the template codes. Separation of templates from the generator repo can causes an issue for both maintainers and developers, since template developers sometimes need to do workarounds to address generator issues they encounter during development. This project will start the improved way of developing and maintaining templates for the AsyncAPI initiative. Key deliverables include: dynamic code generation from AsyncAPI specs using the React engine with integrated Kafka support, extensions support for AMQP and MQTT protocols, and a Kubernetes CRD integration.",

This involves creating a new protocol which will function as a intermediary layer within the I/O path. This protocol will support both asynchronous and synchronous modes, providing a zero-cost layer of abstraction for synchronous operations within a broader asynchronous framework.\r\n\r\nThis new I/O protocol is crux of the project. There will exist servicing pools that will be threaded in parallel to concurrently invoke multiple operations within a single thread without blocking on any individual operation. We must not block on any single operation because that would merit the creation of a new thread, which is exactly what this project is aiming to address. Given that the current implementation is highly synchronous, primarily relying on blocking, certain fundamental I/O primitives at the lowest layer of abstraction within the path will need to be restructured.\r\n\r\nOnce implemented, we will begin integrating this protocol into the system at large, starting from the lowest layer of abstraction within the I/O path moving upwards, then finally revising the POSIX AIO interface.",

By tracing the system calls executed by the bubblewrap Linux binary and comparing with the ones in compat_linux's source code, we can identify the system calls that need to be implemented.\n\nOne required but currently missing Linux system call is unshare, a system call to create Linux namespaces, which provide isolation of multiple parts from the host, this makes it a complicated system call to emulate.\nUnshare will be the main system call of this project but there will be others as well, such as the capabilities family of system calls, we will study each system call individually to understand if we need to create a completely new system call, or if we can simply translate the Linux system call's arguments to ones used by an equivalent NetBSD system call.\n\nThe successful completion of this project will result in a patch to compat_linux, which will allow bubblewrap to be ran on NetBSD under compat_linux, bringing a new way of sandboxing to NetBSD.",

While these exercises serve as valuable educational tools for robotics learners, the current Gazebo environments and robot models lack visual realism, accurate physical behavior, and modular ROS2 integration. To address these limitations, the project will refactor the URDF model used in the Follow Line scenario using modular Xacro descriptions and realistic textures. The line track world will also be improved with high-quality road textures and better lighting for consistent perception results. In the Vacuum Cleaner scenario, the environment will be rebuilt using realistic room furniture and obstacles imported from Blender assets. Additionally, the Roomba robot model will be upgraded for improved physical dynamics, and its SLAM and navigation performance will be enhanced by tuning ROS2 Navigation2 parameters. Common improvements across both scenarios include updating the launch files to align with ROS2 Humble best practices, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of Gazebo such as Fortress or Ignition, and producing clear documentation to support scenario creation and extension. The final deliverables will include the revamped simulation scenarios, reusable robot models, an organized and modular launch structure, and comprehensive user documentation.

          "description": "Abstract: This proposal outlines a plan to enhance Meshery's relationship evaluation capabilities by implementing client-side policy evaluation using WebAssembly. By integrating OPA's WebAssembly compilation capabilities into Meshery's UI, I aim to enable real-time evaluation of complex Rego policies, providing users with immediate feedback on configuration changes and policy compliance. This enhancement will significantly improve the user experience when designing their designs and will make the policy evaluation distributed hence reducing load on a meshery server Problem Statement Meshery currently doesn't support evaluating policies in real-time on the client side. The existing approach ( relying on the rest api interface exposed by meshery-server) introduce s latency when policy evaluation occurs server-side, limiting the responsiveness of the UI when users make configuration changes. Additionally, as policies become more complex and numerous, the ability to quickly validate configurations against these policies becomes increasingly important for a smooth user experience. Proposed Solution: Use opas capibilty to compile rego policies directly into wasm plans and then integrate the evaluation process in ui using OPA's JavaScript SDK, which provides a simpler way to load and evaluate Rego policies compiled to WebAssembly. This approach is more lightweight and performant . Deliverables : - Real time evaluation of policies in ui - Keeping the support for both targets of evaluation backend or realtime on frontend - Making the evaluation responsive and performant by implementing webworkers , caching",

          "description": "This project aims to enhance the security of WasmEdge plug-ins by exporting key WASI APIs, thereby ensuring a robust and secure virtual filesystem sandbox for file operations. With the rapid growth of AI applications, WasmEdge plug-ins have become indispensable for tasks such as natural language processing, image synthesis, and speech recognition. However, direct file system access in current implementations exposes critical security risks. To address this, our proposal focuses on designing and implementing a dedicated filesystem sandbox API that restricts file read/write operations to pre-authorized directories. The initial phase will concentrate on the WASI-NN plug-in and other simpler file I/O functions, with potential future enhancements to more complex applications like Stable Diffusion’s image-loading functionality.\nOur comprehensive plan includes an in-depth study of the WasmEdge sandbox architecture, API design and integration, modification of internal plugin call patterns, and the development of rigorous test cases to validate sandbox effectiveness. Detailed documentation and developer guidelines will be prepared to facilitate secure plugin development. With a project timeline from June 2 to September 1, this initiative will leverage my background in virtualization, parallel computing and my past contributions to WasmEdge. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in the security and isolation of file operations in WasmEdge plug-ins, paving the way for safer and more reliable deployment of AI-driven applications.",

          "description": "Problem:\nVLC’s macOS interface has fallen behind modern design standards, creating a disjointed experience compared to its intuitive iOS/tvOS counterparts. The current AppKit-based UI lacks macOS Sequoia's visual polish, struggles with libvlc’s newer playback features (e.g., frame-accurate seeking), and suffers from inefficient media library management. This outdated design hinders usability and fails to make use of macOS’s native capabilities.\n\nSolution:\nRedesign VLC’s macOS interface using AppKit to implement a pre-approved, user-tested design that integrates into macOS visual aesthetics and libvlc’s advanced APIs. The overhaul will:\n1. Replace legacy Carbon-era UI components with modern NSCollectionView and NSSplitViewController layouts.\n2. Integrate libvlc’s latest playback controls (frame stepping, HDR metadata) into native transport UIs.\n3. Rebuild the media library using Core Data for performance and NSDiffableDataSource for real-time updates.\n4. Prioritize system consistency with SF Symbols, vibrant materials, and macOS accessibility standards.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Modern UI Components:\n- Unified toolbar with adaptive controls (NSToolbarItemGroup)\n- Redesigned media library with thumbnail grid (NSCollectionView) and smart filters (NSPredicateEditor)\n2. Enhanced Playback:\n- Frame-accurate seekbar with NSSlider tick marks synced to libvlc’s next_frame() API\n- HDR tone mapping toggle using CAMetalLayer integration\n3. Optimized Media Management:\n- Rules-based playlists backed by Core Data\n- Spotlight-like search using NSFetchRequest\n4. Developer Documentation:\n- Migration guide for plugin developers\n- NSAccessibility implementation notes\n\nBy collaborating closely with VLC’s core team and iterating on the existing codebase, this project will deliver a performant, native macOS experience that bridges the gap between VLC’s powerful engine and modern user expectations.",

CICADA currently uses a distilled neural network model with layer-wise quantization to meet the strict sub-500ns latency required for the CMS L1T. This project involves developing a HGQ version of the CICADA distilled model and evaluating its performance and resource consumption when deployed on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), while contributing to the open-source CICADA, HGQ2 and hls4ml frameworks as needed. Notably, the HGQ2 library is also compatible with JAX, opening the door for future integration with modern, hardware-friendly ML ecosystems. These contributions will benefit the broader fast machine learning community focused on deploying ML models in low-latency, resource-constrained environments.",

Hls4ml is an open-source project that translates machine learning (ML) models to high-level synthesis (HLS) code for deployment on hardware accelerators. The idea stems from the high-energy physics community at CERN. Google XLS (Accelerated Hardware Synthesis) is a novel framework that implements an HLS toolchain to produce synthesizable code for FPGA and ASIC applications. Thus, XLS can be integrated as one of the backends in hls4ml for transforming ML models into synthesizable code.\n\nThe goal of this project is to integrate an XLS-based backend for the hls4ml framework. In doing so, hls4ml benefits from improved vendor compatibility and portability while also offering the potential to increase hardware efficiency. During development, we will benchmark performance and resource utilization against the existing backends (e.g., AMD Vivado, Intel Quartus). Furthermore, XLS provides a domain-specific language (DSL) called DSLX and an optimized compiler that can reduce compilation time.\n\nThe expected results are an XLS backend prototype and benchmarks performed on various metrics for the synthesized code.

However, due to bandwidth and storage limitations, only a fraction of the produced data can be stored. To ensure that CERN’s scientists can benefit from having as much data as possible, lossy compression techniques can be considered as a possible solution to CERN’s high data volume challenge. A promising contender in data compression techniques is “BALER,” a machine-learning-based compression tool under development by the particle physics divisions of the University of Manchester. Through the utilization of autoencoder neural networks, significant levels of compression while maintaining high accuracy have been achieved for a variety of datasets, including highly-dimensional LHC datasets and 2D images.\n\nThrough Google Summer of Code 2025, I plan to collaborate with HSF, Manchester, and BALER to enhance their current compression model, tailoring it for physics-specific experimental data, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction for scientific investigation and analysis. Specifically, I plan to implement a physics-informed autoencoder model and evaluate its performance on open LHC datasets. Leveraging my past experience with Tensorized Physics-Informed Neural Networks, I aim to integrate physical laws directly into the autoencoder architecture and loss function, ensuring that compressed representations maintain physical validity. Furthermore, comparing reconstructed data against the original collected data will highlight outliers and physical abnormalities. Finally, I plan to document all experiments and evaluate the physics-informed autoencoder against BALER’s current performance when compressing real-world physics experiment data. With aid from my mentors, I hope to deploy this specialized version of BALER’s tool for CERN and other groups who could benefit from powerful physics-aware data compression.",

Modern calorimeters generate sparse, high-dimensional data that challenges machine learning approaches. I'm developing a physics-informed clustering framework that intelligently reduces this dimensionality while preserving essential physics information through two complementary algorithms: a Modified DBSCAN with CLUE elements and a Graph-Based approach that leverages simulation history. Both utilize physics-informed distance metrics incorporating spatial, energy, and time information and employ a cell-aware strategy that clusters dense regions aggressively when within detector cells while preserving structure between them.\n\nDeliverables:\nThe deliverables include an end-to-end pipeline that transforms detailed Geant4 shower data into optimized point cloud representations, two physics-preserving clustering algorithms, and an evaluation framework that quantifies how well these representations maintain critical shower properties while significantly reducing data complexity. This optimized representation will enable efficient training of generative models for fast calorimeter simulation, addressing a key challenge in high-luminosity experiments.",

          "description": "In high-energy physics experiments such as those conducted at CERN's ATLAS project, the volume of data generated is immense, reaching up to 60 million MB per second. While lossless compression is already employed to manage this data, lossy compression—specifically of floating-point precision—offers more aggressive reductions, potentially decreasing file sizes by over 30%. However, this comes at the cost of irreversibly discarding information, raising the challenge of how to recover or approximate full-precision data for downstream analysis.\n\nThis project proposes a novel approach using deep probabilistic models to reconstruct high-precision floating-point data from aggressively compressed representations, a problem coined as precision upsampling. The goal is to explore and compare the capabilities of three classes of generative models: autoencoders, diffusion models, and normalizing flows. Each model type offers distinct advantages: autoencoders are well-studied in neural compression, diffusion models are robust to noise and excel in reconstructing multi-scale structures, and normalizing flows offer exact likelihood estimation and invertible mappings that align well with the structured nature of physical data.\n\nDeliverables include a literature review on neural precision upsampling methods, a working baseline model adapted to CERN's PHYSLITE floating-point compressed data, and a comparative study of advanced probabilistic models—including variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and normalizing flows. Evaluation metrics will also be tailored to the data and implemented. Final outputs will include reproducible code, performance benchmarks, a written technical report, and optionally a publication or integration into the ATLAS codebase.",

This project is to make one nice website using Hugo that have all useful things in one place – like what is KDE Linux, how to download it, join community, ask for help, and more.\r\n\r\nThe website will be easy to use and mobile friendly. It will have pages like About, Download, Community, FAQ and Support. There will be search bar, dark/light mode, multi-language, and CI to auto-update download links. I also write guides for installing KDE Linux, and FAQs like how to install app or fix common problems. There will be links to Matrix, Mastodon and more KDE places where people talk and share.\r\n\r\nI already made starting version of the website before applying. I will now improve it step by step in GSoC time. After GSoC, I will still keep working to make it better and fix things. I want to help KDE Linux grow and make more people try it.

          "description": "The primary goal of this project is to refactor Akonadi’s agents and resources by\ndecoupling their configuration dialogs from their underlying logic. This change will\nallow us to remove the inclusion of heavy QtWidgets header files, which currently\nlead to unnecessary memory usage. Reducing this overhead is essential for making\nthe Merkuro suite fully usable on mobile devices, where resource constraints are\ncritical.\nAt present, many components load their GUI elements by default, unnecessarily\nincreasing the memory footprint and hindering performance on resource-constrained\nplatforms. By refactoring these configuration dialogs into separate, dynamically\nloaded plugins, the agents and resources can run leaner and more efficiently (it\nwould save around 15-20 Mib of RAM per agent/resource) while still providing\nfull-featured configuration interfaces when needed by host applications.\nProject Deliverables\n● Refactor as many as reasonably possible of the selected Akonadi agents\nand resources within the GSoC timeframe. The goal is not necessarily to port\nall agents, but to make meaningful progress and establish a repeatable\npattern for others to follow, ensuring the project is successful even if not every\ntarget is completed.\n● Eliminate embedded QtWidgets dependencies—such as replacing\nQApplication with QCoreApplication—in their primary functionality.\n● Identify and replace additional usages of QtWidgets beyond the configuration\ndialogs—such as QMessageBox instances used to show error messages.\n● Modify build configurations (CMake files) to strip out unnecessary UI files and\nreduce dependencies, thereby lowering memory usage.\n● Create dedicated configuration plugins that encapsulate the GUI functionality\npreviously embedded within agents and resources.\n● Test and document all changes to verify that memory usage is indeed reduced\nand that the new plugin-based configuration system functions correctly across\nboth desktop and mobile environments.",

          "description": "RIPE Atlas publishes traceroute measurement results. A measurement result can have a large volume of data. One example of a large volume measurement is as mentioned below: \n\n\"Given around 12000 probes worldwide and the system collects traceroute data from these probes every 15 mins. The measurement has been running for 2+ years. The maximum hops a probe made in this measurement was 32.\"\n\nRIPE Atlas provides a REST API to fetch the measurement result. However, the measurement result object can be a large json response. It increases the memory usage on the server while creating a huge response. If the server succeeds in creating a huge response, the client device may not afford to render an SVG graph given the large traceroute data. \n\nThe main goal for this project is to enable the visualizer to handle traceroute measurement results of any volume. This can mainly be achieved by \n- Narrowing down the search according to the inputs (probe ids to include, time frame) provided by the user\n- Paginate the measurement result API call by probe ids, start time and stop time\n\nExperiment rendering the network graph using more efficient graph libraries and test. If by testing, the results are improved then replace the current implementation of v-network-graph. \n\nAlso, there is a scope for UI enhancements. The main thought process behind thinking UI enhancement for this project was this:\n\"The data which we can provide should simply be there on the graph when the user needs it. \nThis UI enhancement can be achieved by adding another “Detailed mode” to the network graph.\" \nDuring the GSoC timeline, I will be executing testing strategies, fixing the underlying issues of the traceroute visualizer and documenting my work.",

          "description": "As we plan to take the PSLab project to the next level, developing multiplatform support for the app and enhancing its communication capabilities are key to making PSLab more accessible and effective for students, educators, and science enthusiasts across diverse environments.\n\nCurrently, the Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) mobile application is available only for Android, limiting its usability in institutions where iOS, desktop, or web platforms are widely used. This project aims to rebuild the existing Android app using Flutter, enabling support for Android, iOS, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and web, all from a single codebase. Flutter’s flexibility and performance make it an ideal choice for this cross-platform transformation, ensuring a smooth user experience across all device types and screen sizes.\n\nAnother crucial part of this project is enhancing the hardware communication layer to accommodate platform-specific constraints—particularly Apple’s restrictions on USB communication. To address this, the project will implement Wi-Fi-based connectivity using the ESP01 chip, allowing seamless data transfer between the app and the PSLab hardware across all platforms. This ensures that iOS and web users are no longer at a disadvantage and can fully utilize the PSLab instruments.\n\nBy the end of the project, the app will offer a robust, real-time interface for core instruments like the Oscilloscope, Logic Analyzer, Multimeter, and Robot Controls, complete with interactive visualizations.",

          "description": "This project aims to deliver a fully-featured, cross-platform canvas-based editor for the Magic ePaper Badge, built entirely in Flutter without relying on third-party libraries. The application empowers users to create intricate badge designs with a highly customizable interface tailored specifically for ePaper screens, supporting tri-color rendering (red, white, black) and precise editing controls.\n\nKey features include a custom drawing canvas with gesture-based freehand and line drawing tools, a text overlay system with support for font selection, scaling, rotation, and locking, and an image import module allowing for multi-image manipulation on the canvas. A layer manager provides real-time reordering of image and text overlays, mirroring professional design software like Photoshop.\n\nA polished preview and export pipeline ensures clean final renders. Users can crop and adjust the final image with brightness and contrast controls before exporting it at the badge’s native resolution (240x416). The result is optimized for both BWR and BW UC8252 display variants.\n\nThe project also includes robust NFC integration. I resolved critical issues in the original codebase, such as improper handling when NFC was disabled. I implemented a native Android method that navigates directly to the system’s NFC settings screen, significantly improving UX and cross-device reliability. The app now ensures seamless transmission of finalized designs to the ePaper badge over NFC.\n\nBy implementing all functionality from scratch, this project delivers a performance-optimized, extensible editor tailored for the Magic ePaper Badge ecosystem, advancing FOSSASIA’s vision of accessible, user-driven customization tools.",

          "description": "This project aims to improve the Debian packaging process for FOSSology, an open-source license compliance tool. Currently, FOSSology relies on CPack for packaging, which has limitations in flexibility and Debian policy compliance. This proposal suggests transitioning to Debian's native packaging tools (dpkg, debhelper, and lintian), automating the build process, and integrating continuous integration (CI) for better package management. Deliverables include structured Debian packages, automated build scripts, CI pipelines, and detailed documentation to facilitate future maintenance. This work will make FOSSology more accessible, easier to install, and compliant with Debian standards, benefiting system administrators and developers.",

          "description": "The efficient computation of molecular integrals is crucial for large-scale quantum chemistry calculations to obtain the properties of the system. Gbasis is a free and open-source Python library for molecular property calculations using Gaussian basis functions, which are commonly used in quantum chemistry. It can evaluate various functions expanded in a Gaussian basis set, such as the electron density, as well as integrals over Gaussian basis functions. For all of these computations, a large number of complex integrals must be evaluated. Gbasis can compute various one- and two-electron integrals, but as the system size increases, these integrations become increasingly time- and memory-intensive.\n\nScreening is common in computational chemistry, and most codes use it to skip unnecessary integral evaluations. Currently, Gbasis applies screening only to overlap integrals. The aim of this project is to extend screening to other one-electron and two-electron integrals. By evaluating different types of integrals, a variety of properties such as the electrostatic potential, electron density, and its derivatives can be obtained. These evaluations are typically performed on a spatial grid, and screening for such grid-based evaluations will also be addressed in this work.",

          "description": "My GSoC 2025 proposal focuses on enhancing the \"Transformed Cubic Grids\" framework (Issue #264) within the QC-Devs organization by implementing adaptive quadrature methods. Current Becke-style molecular grids suffer from overlapping atomic grids, leading to redundant computations and reduced accuracy in quantum chemistry simulations. Building on prior work (Issues #7, #15, #96), I will develop algorithms to dynamically adjust grid points and weights based on integrand behavior, such as electron density, ensuring high accuracy with fewer points. My deliverables include refreshing and merging Pull Request #136, implementing adaptive methods (e.g., trapezoidal or Simpson’s rule with refinement), writing comprehensive tests and documentation, and creating Jupyter notebook tutorials for practical use in molecular property calculations.",

The goal is to create ensemble-ready inputs that enable sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. As a stretch goal, the project will implement an integrated workflow that runs the SIPNET model over these ensembles and performs variance partitioning to quantify the contribution of each data source to model output uncertainty. \nCurrent variance decomposition in PEcAn only supports parameter uncertainty. This project aims to address this gap by developing modular data preparation workflows that propagate and analyze uncertainty from multiple sources—including parameter, meteorological data, soil data and vegetation initial conditions. \nDeliverables include reusable R functions, data preparation modules, documentation, and example workflows integrated into the PEcAn system.",

The solution involves auditing current modules (query.traits.R, query.yields.R, query.citations.R, etc.) to identify database-dependent components, and systematically refactoring them to support alternative data sources like CSV, JSON, or lightweight SQLite databases.\nAdditionally, tools will be developed for syncing offline results back to BETYdb when needed, preserving compatibility. \nKey deliverables include a standalone trait dataset, workflow execution independent of PostgreSQL, improved module interoperability, and documentation updates to support adoption.

LNS simplifies multiplication and division, potentially reducing power consumption and improving efficiency in applications like deep learning, where approximate results are acceptable. However, current deep-learning frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, are hardcoded to use floating-point (FP) operations, limiting the adoption of LNS.\n\nWe seek to bridge that gap by developing a system that supports LNS arithmetic while maintaining compatibility with PyTorch. By creating custom layers, optimizers, and benchmarking tools, the project will enable the simulation of LNS arithmetic in FP hardware for neural network training and inference. The expected outcome is a robust, open-source solution to make research and exploration of LNS in deep-learning applications easier, paving the way for future hardware implementations.",

          "description": "Metagenomic assembly is essential for understanding microbial communities, but existing tools often struggle with fragmented genomes, misclassified errors, and scalability issues. My goal is to develop a distributed algorithm for error correction and assembly, making it easier to process large and complex metagenomic datasets efficiently.\n\nTo achieve this, I plan to use distributed computing frameworks like Dask to improve scalability, ensuring that even terabyte-scale datasets can be handled smoothly. I also aim to design better error correction techniques to preserve low-abundance species and improve assembly accuracy. Additionally, I want to explore GPU acceleration and machine learning to refine error detection and optimize processing times.\n\nAt the core of my approach is a distributed de Bruijn graph assembly algorithm that constructs graphs from k-mers while clustering and annotating nodes based on coverage, GC content, and paired-end data. Unlike existing tools like Velvet (designed for single-genome assembly) and MetaVelvet (for metagenomic assembly), my method will efficiently break down graphs into species-specific subgraphs, reducing errors and improving the quality of the final assemblies. This will lead to better contig generation, taxonomic classification, and error correction, while also ensuring the method scales well for large datasets.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. A distributed error correction module that improves accuracy while retaining biologically important data.\n2. An optimized assembly pipeline to generate high-quality contigs and scaffolds for taxonomic and functional analysis.\n3. A novel species-aware de Bruijn graph decomposition to improve metagenomic assembly and reduce errors.\n4. Scalability improvements to ensure smooth performance across HPC clusters and cloud platforms.\n5. AI/ML enhancements to improve error correction and sequencing accuracy.\n6.

Rising sea levels, melting sea ice, and shifting environmental conditions make accurate modeling of coastal changes a pressing need.

This will build upon the existing pipeline and model by re-training the water detection (NDWI-based) and segmentation methods to perform well on PlanetLabs’ imagery.\nFurther aims include:\nEnsuring the extraction is robust in challenging conditions such as water shadows, buildings, artifacts, and especially steep, cliff-like coastal areas.\nIntegrating additional data sources if needed, such as SWIR data   \nthe project will also explore the use of auxiliary data sources (Landsat & sentinel) and  elevation data for addition of topographic information, to improve accuracy.\n\nUltimately producing a finished model that can process large amounts of imagery and accurately predict coastline changes over time, which is essential for improving coastal erosion forecasts in Alaska considering the effects of climate change.",

          "description": "The BeamVision extension revolutionizes interactive pipeline development in JupyterLab by transforming fragmented notebook visualizations into an integrated workspace, as envisioned in the original design document. At its core lies a dynamic side panel that fundamentally reimagines how users inspect Apache Beam pipelines - consolidating previously scattered visualizations while preserving the documented backward compatibility requirements. This architectural shift directly addresses the project's stated pain points of vertical space consumption and redundant JavaScript code by implementing the described collapsible interface and centralized rendering system. The solution carefully balances innovation with technical constraints through a hybrid approach combining kernel-side HTML generation for reliability with frontend D3.js rendering for interactivity, both explicitly prioritized in the project's technical specifications. Beyond basic visualization, the implementation delivers on the documented cluster management capabilities, providing seamless Flink/Dataproc integration exactly as outlined in the side panel use cases. Every component maintains strict adherence to the original vision - from the multi-tab comparison interface described in the design workflow to the incremental data loading strategy for large datasets. By systematically executing the documented requirements without introducing unsupported features, BeamVision transforms the proposal's vision of \"better UX when exploring pipeline states\" into a production-ready reality while laying foundations for future extensibility through the approved plugin architecture. The result is a purpose-built environment that finally unlocks Apache Beam's full potential within JupyterLab, precisely as the project architects intended.",

          "description": "Cmm is the intermediate representation and code generation layer used by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). It is written in Haskell and sits between GHC's high-level STG output and low-level native or LLVM code generation.\n\n Cmm enables multiple backends: a fast native code generator and a more sophisticated LLVM backend. In principle, this design allows users to choose between faster compilation or better runtime performance.\n\nHowever, like other parts of GHC, the documentation for Cmm is sparse, fragmented, and in many places outdated. For example, references to Static Single Assignment (SSA) form often describe it as \"future work,\" even though there has been a prior attempt at implementing it. There is no cohesive documentation to explain what was done, how the backend currently works, or how one might extend it. This is an obstacle to contributors, researchers, and users alike.\n\nIn practice, the LLVM backend suffers from long compile times and a fragile implementation. It depends on a custom LLVM AST that is hard to maintain, and requires users to install a specific, outdated version of LLVM. Meanwhile, the native backend is fast but unable to fully optimize performance-critical code.\n\nThis project proposes to address these issues in stages:\n1. Document the Cmm pipeline, the backend interfaces, and existing SSA infrastructure.\n2. Then, depending on the mentor's and community's feedback, pursue one of two improvement paths:",

However, it is presently based on the outdated GHCJS compiler, which is difficult to maintain and incompatible with recent GHC improvements.

With previous experience in compiler development (ANTLR/Java), implementation of interpreters in Haskell, and runtime management in complex networking projects, I have a strong foundation for approaching these efficiently.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nA deployable version of CodeWorld that can be executed using GHC's JavaScript/WebAssembly backend.\n\nModern build scripts, runtime changes, and JavaScript/WASM integration.\n\nFeature parity tests in-depth (interactive graphics, animations, games).\n\nMaintainability optimizations and performance improvements.\n\nDocumentable documentation for future developers.\n\nWhen time permits, I will also make CodeWorld's programming language and the requirements checker tool more educational.",

Any code or sample that requires GPU-intensive resources will be transferred to OKE infra instead of generic GitHub infra for faster and more efficient execution.\nFor now, the idea is to have a specific policy that whenever any Jupyter Notebook code will be added to a trainer/examples/pytorch/** folder (e.g., in trainer/example/pytorch/image-generation/sample.ipynb), that action is transferred to OKE infra by the GitHub self runner. For security reasons, this process will require manual approval from one of the maintainers to trigger the self-runner build. I will set up the GitHub workflow to monitor changes in the respective folder. Once approved, the CI action will execute the code using the GitHub self-runner on the OKE infrastructure. Additionally, we will set up a dashboard for monitoring and metrics to understand usage patterns and identify bottlenecks.\nThe scope of this project is set up on OKE, but theoretically, this is platform-agnostic; it can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster with sufficient GPU resources.",

Plus, there’s no easy way for other universities to customize or integrate the platform to fit their needs. This makes the app less flexible and limits its potential to be a truly unified solution for higher education in Greece.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nI’m proposing MyUni—a unified, open-source platform that fixes these headaches. Built with a modern MERN stack (Next.js, Express.js, MySQL), MyUni will offer a scalable backend, real-time data syncing via APIs, and a flexible CMS for announcements and updates. It’ll support multiple universities with customizable branding and layouts, all wrapped in a user-friendly interface. Using TypeScript, microservices, and tools like Nginx and Redis, I’ll ensure it’s fast, secure, and ready to grow.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n By the end of GSoC 2025, I’ll deliver:  \n* Web application that provide good user experience(UX) and has\ngood User Interface(UI)\n* Admin dashboard where myuni admin can able to handle CMS and more\n* Student dashboard where student can able to take-care of their profile,\nnotifications of academics, and more\n* Backend Architecture which serves as solution to all project\nrequirements\n* REST APIs with at least 95% test coverage\n* REST APIs with modern design patterns\n* Docker container image of entire app",

CO occupies a single site, while O₂ dissociates into two oxygen atoms placed on adjacent sites. When a CO and an O atom meet, they form CO₂, which leaves the surface and frees up space. As the CO partial pressure (yCO) changes, the surface transitions from oxygen-poisoned (no CO₂ production) to reactive (CO₂ formation) and eventually to CO-poisoned. Apothesis is a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator that models these surface reactions with high precision.\n\n\nThis project will build a Python-based “outer shell” around Apothesis to identify transition points using machine learning.

          "description": "The proposal aims to provide a feature to enable WHOIS details lookup and fuzzy location creation and using those details to enhance OpenWISP’s device management capabilities. \n\nThe implementation involves fetching WHOIS details for a device when last_ip changes for a device and is public via using `geoip2` library. This task is performed asynchronously in background via celery without blocking main thread. Fuzzy locations are identified through `fuzzy` field. Using custom filters will enable filtering instances having `fuzzy` locations on admin level. At API level, `django-filters` will be used to provide the similar filtering functionalities as admin to maintain consistency.  Using a BriefSerializer for summary details and a DetailedSerializer for complete details fetch of WHOIS record on API level for device details and list APIs will provide flexibility. The fuzzy locations will be managed at global and organizational level using `FallbackBooleanChoiceField`, maintaining consistency with existing configuration practices.\n\nAs per above implementation, this feature will allow users to get WHOIS details of their devices if its 'last_ip' changes and is public ip allowing to manage it better and get its estimate location—unless manually refined. Updated locations will trigger notifications, improving device visibility and management. Users will be able to enable/disable fuzzy locations via configuration at global/organization level. The WHOIS record will be fetched at summary level (on device details and list APIs) and an option to view detailed view on device details API. The Device admin UI will display the newly fetched WHOIS details alongside last_ip with filters for devices having fuzzy locations. The Location admin interface will include clear indicators for fuzzy locations, along with filters to help users identify and manage such locations.

It will allow users to toggle between different layers, interact with body structures dynamically, and engage in real-time collaborative learning through a dedicated \"Doctor Mode.\" Additional features such as interactive quizzes, UI/UX refinements, and localization support will ensure accessibility and usability across different regions and devices.\n\nThe second component, the Stickman Animation Activity, will introduce an interactive keyframe animation tool where users can manipulate a stick figure by adjusting its nodes to create animations. This tool will support essential animation features such as playback, speed control, and exporting animations as videos. It will also include a collection of pre-designed templates for common movements like running, jumping, and dancing. A standout feature of this activity is the ability to import a photo of a human body and generate a corresponding stick figure in the same pose using AI-assisted pose detection.\n\nBy the end of the project, Sugar Labs will gain two fully functional, optimized, and localized activities that provide immersive learning experiences in human anatomy and animation principles. The enhancements to the 3D Human Body Activity will enable students to explore anatomy in a more interactive and engaging way, moving beyond static textbook images to dynamic 3D models.

          "description": "This project will develop the core execution engine for Music Blocks 4, an educational platform that helps students explore music, mathematics, and programming through block-based coding. The Program Engine will allow users to create musical programs by arranging visual blocks and then execute these programs to generate music with precise timing.\n\nI will implement a robust Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of programs, an interpreter that executes block instructions, a state manager to track variables and program state, and a scheduler for time-based musical operations. Key deliverables include a complete execution system for basic programming constructs, music generation capabilities, concurrent execution for multi-part compositions, and comprehensive error handling to provide clear feedback to users.\n\nThe end result will be a performant, reliable foundation that enables Music Blocks users to create, share, and learn through interactive musical programming, with special attention to educational use cases and accessibility.",

The current system lacks modularity and intuitive interaction, limiting ease of use and extensibility.\n\nTo address this, I will deep dive into the existing Music Blocks v4 and builder module, leveraging libraries like React Aria, React Spectrum, and Storybook to build reusable UI primitives with accessibility and performance in mind. Key components include a configurable brick rendering engine, infinite scrolling workspace, and a dynamic palette with categorized blocks. Interactions like drag-and-drop, snapping, connection/disconnection, and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) serialization will be enhanced for clarity and usability.\n\nDeliverables include an improved brick rendering and interaction logic, real-time visual feedback during user actions, support for infinite scrolling, fully functional Palette UI, comprehensive documentation, and a clean, testable codebase ready for future expansion.

Upon successful implementation, the turtle/mouse glyph will be able to detect the color of pixels underneath it, regardless of whether those pixels were drawn by the turtle/mouse itself, part of an uploaded image stamped to the canvas, or part of a live webcam video feed into Music Blocks.

          "description": "The project aims to develop an intelligent code review agent that integrates with GitHub and other version control systems (VCS). This tool will provide automated, insightful feedback on code quality by combining traditional static analysis with AI-powered insights.\n\nProblem Being Solved\nCode reviews are often time-consuming and inconsistent, especially when identifying complex issues such as security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and maintainability concerns. This project addresses these challenges by automating the review process while providing actionable, contextual feedback.\n\nProposed Solution\nThe solution employs a modular webhook-based architecture with the following components:\n1. A webhook receiver to capture GitHub events (e.g., pull request creations/updates).\n2. A code fetcher to retrieve and parse changed files.\n3. An orchestrator to coordinate multiple analysis tools.\n4. A result aggregator to combine findings and remove duplicates.\n5. A response handler to post intelligent comments directly on pull requests.\n\nKey Deliverables\n1. A system that provides actionable, contextual feedback rather than merely flagging issues.\n2. Support for multiple programming languages (initially Go, JavaScript, and Python).\n3. Implementation of dependency vulnerability detection.\n4. An AI-powered layer to enhance basic linter outputs.\n5. Extensibility for future language support and additional features.",

I propose enhancing Keploy’s contract testing by implementing local schema storage as a mock registry, unifying schemas into a single service contract, adding advanced comparison with dependency resolution and real-time validation, and introducing provider-driven testing with contract publishing and rollback capabilities. My solution builds on a Go-based prototype, utilizing tools like Cobra, YAML, and Docker, with extensibility to S3. Deliverables include an integrated CLI with versioning and multi-format support, schema merging with diffing and real-time validation, and a provider-driven testing framework with rollback, all supported by comprehensive documentation and tests.

(Project-2)\n\nProblem solved - Current AI models struggle to generate high-quality Unit Tests for large codebases without a deep, structured understanding of the source code.\n\nSolution Plan- \n1. I implemented code parsing using tree-sitter to create semantic chunks, preserving essential context.\n2. Then generating embeddings for these chunks with Gemini, openAI, huggigface and store them in a Milvus vector database.\n3. I'm utilizing HNSW indexing within Milvus for efficient semantic similarity search.\n4. Then I have extracted code relationships (function calls, class inheritance etc.) and store them as a knowledge graph in Neo4j.\n5. Embeddings are generated with Gemini :- https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard\n6. I have developed a dynamic indexing mechanism (using file watching/Git hooks, potentially enhanced by Difftastic) to keep both Milvus and Neo4j synchronized with code changes.\n7. Then I build a hybrid retrieval system querying both Milvus (for semantic relevance) and Neo4j (for structural context).\n8. Then I integrated this combined context into Keploy's existing Unit Test Generation (UTG) workflow, feeding it to the Gemini API for test creation.\n9.  Then I need further suggestion to implement an LLM-as-a-judge component to evaluate the generated tests.\n\nDeliverables:- A robust GraphRAG system integrated into Keploy. This includes codebase indexing (vector embeddings in Milvus, structural graph in Neo4j), dynamic index updates, hybrid context retrieval, and integration with the Gemini, leading to substantially improved Unit Test Generation quality and relevance for users with large or complex codebases.\n\nThanks.\nRegards\nSparsh.",

          "description": "The RADIS code was developed for the characterization of plasmas, flames and atmospheres. High-temperature spectral calculations are required to resolve the shape of tens of millions of lines, which is the usual performance bottleneck. RADIS implements a new algorithm to compute these lineshapes and is already one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available. It can also compute many different types of spectra (absorption/emission/equilibrium / non-equilibrium). In a typical calculation, a database of coefficients is loaded and these coefficients are multiplied according to physics laws to generate a set of line strengths in a spectrum. RADIS can also handle different molecular databases such as HITRAN, HITEMP, EXOMOL, and GEISA.\n\nWith more and more lines added to the databases, some files grew considerably in size. To be as fast as possible, RADIS convert compressed databases into the HDF5 format. This conversion also increases the size of the files which can take hours to be written in the hard drive (2-3 hours for HITEMP CO2 in its 2025 version). The objective of this project is to accelerate the parsing to HDF5 files.",

Capa is an effective tool for identifying malware capabilities on the Windows platform, but currently lacks support for Android threats. With the surge in Android malware, attackers increasingly combine code obfuscation, native libraries (.so files), and anti-analysis techniques, limiting the effectiveness of traditional static analysis methods in detecting Android malware.\nI will extend capa by developing a new component called AndroidFeatureExtractor, which uses the Frida dynamic instrumentation framework to monitor Java and native code layer behaviors at runtime. The extracted behavioral features will be seamlessly mapped to capa's existing feature model, allowing security analysts to leverage the rule system they are already familiar with, while making appropriate adjustments for Android-specific execution environments. This project provides security researchers with a systematic feature extraction tool that can be used to design rules for identifying complex Android malware capabilities specifically designed to evade traditional detection.",

          "description": "InVesalius is an open-source software that enables synchronous 2D and 3D visualization of medical images, facilitating the reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data into three-dimensional models. It allows users to create masks easily through various preset parameters, such as predefined threshold values for different tissues and materials. However, in cases where automatic segmentation is insufficient, manual editing becomes necessary. This process can be quite slow and labor-intensive, as it requires editing each slice individually, which is particularly time-consuming for large volumes.\n\nImplementing a feature that enables mask creation through projections directly on the 3D rendering screen would significantly enhance InVesalius's usability and \nefficiency. Currently, mask editing in InVesalius requires a slice-by-slice approach, which can be repetitive and prone to errors.

This project aims to enhance usability by implementing a wxPython-based progress dialog with real-time updates and cancellation support. I’ll integrate this into invesalius/control.py and gui/frame.py, threading file operations (OpenPlistProject, SavePlistProject) and upgrading Volume.Render’s feedback with VTK-based stages. Deliverables include: (1) a cancellable progress dialog for .inv3 loading, (2) a similar dialog for saving, (3) a revamped volume rendering dialog with percentage updates, and (4) unit tests ensuring reliability. Built with Python, wxPython, and NumPy, this will make InVesalius more intuitive and responsive for researchers and clinicians.",

The target is to make it possible for developers to scan their code for license and security issues automatically in their everyday development processes.\n\nOne of the biggest aspects of the project is enhancing the management of software dependencies. It will feature tools that identify whether any of the libraries a project is based on have known vulnerabilities. When they have, the system will recommend alternatives that are safer, automatically test them, and create a pull request if the updates are compatible.\n\nAnother area of emphasis is enhancing the way license information is managed—making it more uniform and readable. The project will also assist in identifying third-party code and creating the necessary metadata to provide accurate attribution and license clarity.\n\nNotably, the project also seeks to enhance compliance. It will make automated checks to verify code adheres to license and security policies defined by organizations. If something is amiss, it can alert early during development, keeping teams compliant without additional effort.",

Additionally, the current implementation of Sub-Treversal Partitioning (STP) incurs high CPU overhead during startup, minimizing the system's performance benefits. This project will optimize STP to reduce CPU usage and improve startup efficiency.\nFinally, Gigaflow’s newness requires further optimization in the compilation, LTM, and driver pipeline, alongside additional testing for alternative strategies for priority selection and rule deletion.

One of such possibilities is to explore the adoption of the results of MLIR project to be used within P4C.\n\n\nIn particular, we aim to develop a P4-specific MLIR dialect (P4HIR) that would allow reuse the infrastructure, code analysis, and transformation passes that have recently been developed within MLIR framework.",

          "description": "P4 empowers developers to program the data plane of network devices—switches, routers, and NICs—at a level of detail previously only accessible to hardware designers. P4 software/simulated switches like BMv2 make the development even easier by having the programs and control plane run on developers' computers and give instant feedback. \n\nThis project aims to further improve the capability of BMv2 and enable a potentially broader insight for developers to analyze their P4 program. \n\nWhile traditionally one packet only goes through one path within the switch and thus obtains only one result, there are many situations where it is more useful to have all possible outputs from a P4 simulation. For example, we use this for diff testing, to determine whether the switch is doing something correct or something incorrect.\n\nMultiple allowed behaviors and results usually arise from various multi-path constructs (e.g. ECMP, WCMP, or perhaps LAGs) which are often modeled as action profiles/selector in P4. BMv2 currently allows users to set a mode determining action profile/selector behavior, like `round robin` where every time one sends in the same packet, it would invoke the next possible forwarding action (eventually wrapping around).\n\nThe goal of this project is to provide a new mode for BMv2 to output all possible behaviors. This will both require extending the action profile modes, and extending the notion of output from a set of packets to a set of sets of packets.",

To ensure code quality, Uyuni employs two types of tests:\n\n1.

When these tests fail, developers must revisit older tasks, leading to frequent context switching and reduced productivity.\n\n2. Pull Request Acceptance Tests: These tests are run on new pull requests to prevent breakages from reaching the master branch. They provide fast feedback to developers, helping them fix issues while they are still focused on their tasks.\n\nCurrently, Pull Request Acceptance Tests execute most of the test suite, with an average runtime of one hour. This delays feedback for developers and increases infrastructure costs.\n\nThis project aims to develop a machine learning model that, using past pull requests, test results, code coverage data, and other relevant information, predicts which small subset of tests is most likely to fail for a new pull request. Running only this smaller subset of tests will speed up developer feedback, reduce infrastructure costs, and maintain high test coverage.\n\nInspired by Facebook's Predictive Test Selection paper, this project applies and extends its techniques to optimize Uyuni’s testing strategy and increase developer productivity.",

Initially, Uyuni connects to client machines via SSH to install and register the Salt Minion. Once set up, all communication occurs through Salt’s remote execution system, eliminating the need for SSH. Salt gathers package data using grains, pillars, and custom modules, which Uyuni then compares to its centralized SUSE Manager database.\n\nFor CVE auditing, Uyuni fetches security metadata (e.g., CVEs, OVAL data) from upstream sources like Ubuntu Security Notices and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. When Salt reports installed packages, Uyuni analyzes the data and generates patch or upgrade recommendations. APT repositories are mirrored into structured software channels, allowing clients to receive updates without direct internet access.\n\nBuilding on this workflow, I propose extending Uyuni to support Snap packages. While Snap lacks structured CVE metadata, we can implement a version-based upgrade system: Uyuni retrieves the latest Snap versions from the Snap Store and compares them to client versions reported via Salt, suggesting upgrades when newer versions exist.\n\nTo support airgapped environments, we can pre-download .snap and .assert files on a connected system and distribute them through Uyuni’s software channels. Additionally, to manage storage and stability, Uyuni admins can choose which Snap channels (stable, beta, etc.) to mirror—defaulting to stable.\n\nDeliverables: Support Snap auditing, lifecycle management, airgapped environments, testing/validation, and user documentation in Uyuni.",

Building on last year’s openSUSE GSoC project in edge analytics and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, we will create a privacy-first AI research assistant. The agent will leverage Ollama to run LLMs locally, ensuring no sensitive data or queries are sent to the cloud. It will iteratively search and analyze information, combine local knowledge base queries with optional web search, and produce comprehensive markdown reports with citations. Deployment will utilize the SUSE stack (openSUSE Leap as base layer operating system, SUSE Rancher, K3s, Longhorn, and SLE BCI containers) to orchestrate the solution on resource-constrained edge environments. This project aims to deliver a fully open-source research agent that empowers domains like document Q&A, local knowledge bases, and on-site research, all while maintaining data privacy and leveraging openSUSE Leap as base  layer operating system for containerization.",

          "description": "This project aims to extract the Salt event processor from Uyuni's Tomcat web server and turn it into a standalone containerized service. Currently, Tomcat handles both web requests and Salt event processing. The problem is that processing Salt events can be resource-intensive, potentially affecting the performance of the web application also running in Tomcat. By decoupling these components, I'll create a containerized service that processes Salt events independently, improving overall system performance and reliability.\n\nThe implementation will involve extracting the existing Salt event processing logic, packaging it as a standalone service, containerizing it, and extending Uyuni-tools to deploy and manage this new component with scalable considerations. The current event processing logic will be preserved while adding proper scaling, monitoring, and configuration capabilities.\n\nDeliverables include a fully functional Salt event processor containerized service, integration with Uyuni-tools for deployment management, documentation, and performance benchmarks showing improvements. This architectural improvement will allow Tomcat to focus solely on serving web requests while the event processor can handle Salt events in a more scalable manner.",

Deploy tokens are used to provide secure access to repositories and container registries, independent of a user account. Due to this reason, they are used in CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, and third-party integrations. Some of these tokens are configured to have an expiry date at the time of creation. \n\nCurrently, GitLab lacks an automated way to notify users about tokens that are about to expire. This can lead to last-minute troubleshooting and potential downtimes. To address this, we can integrate a notification system that notifies the project owners, group owners and admins at different intervals [14, 7, 1] days through email notifications and webhooks.

We will modify the current Arena implementations to support memory management for JNI as well, through calls to the Swift runtime.

I've been actively working with ROS 2 in my projects and am eager to contribute to tools that improve the developer experience.\n\nThis project focuses on enhancing ROS 2 tracing by enabling it to start after an application has already launched without losing essential initialization data. Currently, tracing must begin before startup to capture the metadata required for meaningful analysis, which limits flexibility and usability.\n\nThe goal is to explore and implement solutions such as reusing cached initialization metadata or leveraging LTTng’s snapshot mode.

Originally developed for ROS 1 Noetic and Gazebo Harmonic as part of the DAVE project, it is currently being migrated to Gazebo Harmonic and ROS 2 Jazzy. This project aims to complete the migration and enhancement of the multibeam sonar plugin, with three main deliverables.\n\nThe first is an enhanced plugin with improved performance through the introduction of half-precision calculations in CUDA. It is expected that this modification will greatly improve frame refresh rates. Numerical accuracy must be carefully taken into account when implementing it, however, and this should involve thorough testing and evaluation using quantitative metrics in comparison to the performance of the single-precision code.\n\nThe second deliverable is the extension of simulation capabilities to support additional sonar types. Building on the existing multibeam sonar, it should be feasible to implement a side-scan sonar with for seafloor imaging, taking into account shadow analysis and directivity patterns like side lobes, for example.\n\nFinally, benchmark integration is essential to make the simulation more practical and accessible. This involves incorporating hardware that is often used in maritime robotics, like the BlueROV, and not only efficiently modeling the vehicle and its sensors, but also offering examples that are effortless to use. These benchmarks will enable the simulation to be validated and more available and beneficial for the general community, researchers, and developers.",

Compile time improvements\n3. Debug tool improvements \n4. test scenario automation through procedural generation.\n\nUpdate everything:\n\nThe first thing to do would be to update rmf_site bevy and all other dependencies to their latest versions. I’ve done this for all my projects since bevy 0.11, and I can do it for rmf_site too.\n\nImprove Compile TImes:\n\nThe next step would be improving compile times. When I tested this project on my local machine. Iterative compile times took around 50 seconds.\n\nWith the appropriate restructuring of crates, slimmer crate imports, more granular feature flags, and the introduction of the mold linker, these recompile times could be cut down to around 2-7 seconds.\n\nImprove debug tools:\n\nAfter that, then comes adding more debug tools. We can add bevy_inspector_egui for bevy entity/component inspection, bevy_tracing for performance optimization via Tracy.\n\nAutomate test scenarios: \n\nLastly, would be adding procedural generation for test sites.\n\nFirst, would be adding initial tests with randomized prefab placement, then moving to procedural room layouts from tiles, then assigning different layout kinds to each of these, (storage room, office room, etc..), and then finally connecting these different layouts together into a single site.",

It takes care of resource constraints between different controllers and hardware components, asynchronous operation of controllers, etc. As of now, controller_manager publishes the diagnostics of itself, and for controllers and hardware components about their lifecycle state and operational statistics such as their periodicity and their execution time. However, A current limitation of the framework is that hardware components, e.g. the ros2_control hardware driver plugin for a given robot, doesn't have a good API for reporting the diagnostics of its own hardware, for instance, the state of the CAN Bus, some internal motor control board stats like temperature, error codes etc. This integration would make the ros2_control, provide complete diagnostics within its ecosystem. This project focuses on setting up an API that hardware manufacturers & driver maintainers can use to report things with minimal code changes to their existing setups.\n\nThis project thus aims to add reporting capabilities to the hardware components with minimal changes. It will also aim to unify the three existing hardware interfaces into one as they currently contain a lot of similar code. \n\nFurthermore, to enhance the contribution, there will also be focus on adding contributions to exisiting widely used Hardware Interfaces with the new API so that the work is adopted with ease, and the community has better references to work off of.",

The solution involves integrating Gemini/Gemma via their respective APIs/libraries, implementing multimodal self-assessment (using visual feedback from rendered UIs), enabling iterative evaluation (allowing models to refine solutions over multiple attempts), expanding the benchmark with complex frontend tasks (e.g., state management, API integration, basic 3D graphics), and automating the entire evaluation pipeline.\n\nDeliverables include the enhanced open-source benchmark with new benchmark tasks, automation scripts, and a public Hugging Face Space displaying continuously updated evaluation results for Gemini, Gemma, and other models, providing a clear, transparent comparison of advanced AI coding capabilities.",

It does so by building a modular smart batching engine for Gemini that teaches the model to think in context-aware batches.\n\nWhat sets EchoGem apart is its focus on modularity and testing—each component is designed to be independently swappable and improvable allowing for open testing and matching different strategies for different parts of the engine. Instead of a naive sliding window or top-k search approach, EchoGem uses semantic clustering of both chunks and questions to form intelligent batch groups. It is also committed to measurable, reproducible gains. Every design decision—whether it's a new chunking strategy or a different context ranking model—can be rigorously backtested using a structured evaluation suite.",

The high-level vision is to move beyond existing multimodal NIAH evals, which are quite basic and only test a single dimension of performance, namely, retrieval.\n\nI aim to solve this gap by extending the framework presented in a recent DeepMind research paper - \"Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries\" - to the multimodal setting.

          "description": "Fine-tuning MLLMs to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance for visual/spatial tasks can be very expensive because of the increased size of visual/spatial data compared to textual data. Stanford researchers have recently developed a simple yet highly effective fine-tuning methodology for an off-the-shelf pre-trained model that allowed the fine-tuned model to develop test-time scaling and achieve strong reasoning performances for language-based tasks. The resulting Stanford s1 model outperformed OpenAI’s o1-preview by up to 27% on competition math questions. The astonishing detail is that the fine-tuning that allowed for test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance required less than 30 minutes, less than $50, and a tiny dataset of size 1000 [1].\n\nNo budget-friendly visual/spatial equivalent of the aforementioned methodology has been developed yet. I propose a project to extend the fine-tuning methodology of Stanford s1 to test-time scaling and reasoning for visual-based/spatial-based tasks. I  aim to use this to fine-tune Gemma 3 MLLMs to develop test-time scaling and achieve strong reasoning performance for visual/spatial tasks. \n\nIf successful, this project will prove that Gemma 3 MLLMs can be fine-tuned to develop test-time scaling and to achieve strong reasoning performance on spatial/visual tasks cost-efficiently, thereby democratizing AI development and opening up possibilities for Gemma 3 models to be effectively fine-tuned for a greater number and variety of tasks. This project will also serve as a very important step towards building next-generation highly effective large vision models, which were previously hindered by training costs. The impressive context window of Gemma 3 models makes them a perfect candidate for context-heavy reasoning of visual/spatial reasoning tasks in this project.\n\nReferences\n[1]\tN.

While multimodal Language Models like Gemini show promise as potential AI research assistants, their capabilities in nuanced scientific reasoning remain largely unevaluated, particularly across diverse scientific domains. Existing benchmarks often focus on general knowledge, single modalities, or lack the depth needed to probe scientific reasoning. This project proposes the creation of SciResearchBench, a novel,\nopen-source multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the scientific reasoning and discovery capabilities of multimodal across key research domains like Chemistry, Materials Science, Biology, and Physics. SciResearchBench will mirror real-world research workflows, encompassing tasks in multimodal data integration, experimental understanding, results interpretation, and hypothesis generation. A core focus will be extensive ablation studies to systematically analyze model sensitivities (prompting, cross-modal integration, grounding, reasoning complexity, context length),\nproviding crucial insights into model failure modes and avenues for improvement. The project deliverables include the curated/generated dataset, robust evaluation code, comprehensive evaluation results for Gemini models, detailed analysis, and the full open-source release of all components to the research community.",

Finally, I will explore how content caches can be used to allow for interconnected questions, whose answers build upon one another, whilst maintaining efficient API usage.\n\nThe project will result in a series of code samples and corresponding documentation covering a range of topics, from the basics of setting up an API key to how we can use Gemini in combination with applications such as Firebase to create a content cache.

While using LLMs as judges offers a promising alternative, evaluation frameworks provide structured tools that harness LLMs for automated assessments, offering metrics, benchmarks, and scalable testing methodologies that overcome manual evaluation limitations. Gemini's integration with evaluation platforms lacks comprehensive documentation compared to providers like OpenAI and Anthropic. Analysis of ten major frameworks reveals scattered integration, decentralized documentation, and limited implementation guidance for Gemini, creating barriers for developers and researchers.\n\nI propose a three-pronged approach to improve Gemini support across evaluation frameworks. First, adding native Gemini support to select frameworks (DeepEval and TruLens) that already offer direct integrations for other providers. Second, enhancing both abstraction-layer and framework-specific documentation, covering API key management, model configuration, and multimodal capabilities. Third, creating framework-specific guides in Python and TypeScript that demonstrate effective combination of library features with Gemini APIs.\n\nFor code deliverables, I will develop native Gemini integration for DeepEval and TruLens frameworks, with pull requests submitted to respective GitHub repositories.

Notably, a new filter API for using GEGL filters replaced an old compatibility API. This provides a new level of flexibility and convenience at the expense of discoverability. Plug-in and filter creators need an accessible and convenient way of discovering what GEGL filters they can make use of. Overall, the plug-in/filter development experience could be improved. Especially the discoverability of available APIs and where to find them.\n\nIn this project I want to implement a new browser for discovering which GEGL filters are available and how they can be used from a plug-in/filter. Then, I want to explore how to merge existing procedure and plug-in browsers with the newly implemented one. Lastly, I want to explore how to further enhance the development experience.

          "description": "A smooth and intuitive onboarding experience is essential for any app, ensuring that users understand its features while maintaining trust and engagement. This project focuses on enhancing the ListenBrainz Android onboarding flow by making it more informative, user-friendly, and privacy-conscious. Key improvements include a dedicated Listen Submission screen to give users full control over which apps contribute listens, clear permission rationales, and fallback mechanisms for denied permissions. Additionally, a revamped sign-in screen will provide better navigation, including a bug report option for easy issue submission.  \n\nThese improvements are crucial for user transparency and trust. By introducing a Listen Submission screen, users can choose how and when their listening data is collected, ensuring privacy and control. Clear permission rationales and fallback handling prevent confusion and provide users with alternative ways to grant necessary permissions. The addition of update prompts and options like disabling battery optimization in settings ensures users stay updated with the latest features and optimizations effortlessly.  \n\nSeamless updates and proactive issue resolution enhance the overall experience. Integrating an update prompt for Play Store and F-Droid users keeps them informed about new releases, while a \"Report Bug\" button on the sign-in screen streamlines feedback collection. These refinements will significantly improve user retention, ensuring ListenBrainz remains a top choice for tracking listening habits while prioritizing privacy and usability.",

The chatbot will be capable of answering queries related to project \nupdates, community decisions, usage guidance, and more—based on real-time \ninformation and past conversations. The core system will utilize a Retrieval-Augmented \nGeneration (RAG) pipeline to dynamically pull relevant data from these sources and \nserve accurate responses to user questions.

          "description": "As stated in the Mifos Forge, Users of Mifos have long had a need to have greater control and flexibility over creating loan and customer onboarding workflows that incorporate internal processes/steps as well as processes involving external systems. This project would center around creating an external integration with a workflow engine such as Flowable or jBPM using the Mifos X REST API as the glue. The auto-generated client library from the back-end enforces the contract between the workflow engine and the core banking system. The core banking and its REST API act as the glue. The result would be a UI-driven workflow engine to allow non-technical users to define these new custom workflows, where they could drag and drop the different steps of the process.",

These components will be derived from shared workflows and designed according to updated design standards and guidelines developed in collaboration with our design lead. We will break down existing flows into base-level elements and reconstruct them into modular, scalable UI components.\n\nThe deliverables will include: A set of core, reusable UI components built with Compose Multiplatform, shared design system with updated design principles and standards, Git-based repository to house the UI components and associated documentation, Sample screens and workflows implemented in a reference fintech app and documentation outlining how to integrate and update apps using the shared UI library.",

The project leverages recent upstream additions to glibc and Linux kernel that enable GCS support in user space, using Yocto and Arm's Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) to emulate and test the architecture-specific functionality. This is a first step in exploring how CRIU might need to change to handle GCS systems, starting with test coverage\n\nProject Deliverables \nJune 2 (coding begins) - GCS-enabled Environment Verified. Yocto + FVP setup is confirmed working. Compiling and running GCS-marked binaries with glibc tunables active.\nJuly 12-16 (Midterm Evaluation) - First GCS ZDTM test added. A basic test that reads verifies TPIDR2_EL0, and explores stack/register consistency across the restore boundary. Integration with --nocr working. Investigation of parasite.c and restorer.c to identify the point at which TLS or control state (e.g., TPIDR2_EL0) could be saved or restored.\nAugust 16-August 23 (Final Evaluation) - Full round-trip test of checkpointing and restoring a GCS-using process. All tunables, toolchain flags, and kernel glibc dependencies documented.\nAugust 31 (Final Results Announced) - Final cleanup and documentation. Tutorial-style instructions provided on how to replicate setup, test flow, and next steps.\nPost GSOC - I will remain available to  support further maintenance, and help  any future contributors pick up.",

This project addresses these issues by introducing a modular Reducer<G> interface to decouple reduction strategies (supporting tools like C-Reduce/Perses), implementing Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD) to group SQL statements by logical dependencies (improving efficiency from O(n²) to O(n log n)), and automating external reducer integration through dynamic script generation.

Besides its native API in C it has bindings for Fortran and Python. PETSc also contains TAO, the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization, a software library supporting MPI and GPUs through CUDA, HIP, Kokkos, or OpenCL. \n\nWhile most of the Fortran interfaces can be generated automatically from the C-API, functions with \"complex\" arguments such as procedure pointers, pointers to arrays, and strings require the manual creation of interface code on both the C and the Fortran side. Moreover, due to the discrepancy of features between C and Fortran, a one-to-one translation of APIs leads to Fortran interfaces that don't leverage the capabilities of modern Fortran. Examples include overloaded functions for different types in Fortran, for which a C-API requires VOID and an explicit type argument and arrays, for which the length is part of the type definition in Fortran but requires a second argument in the C-API.\n\nThis project aims to improve the automation of generating Fortran interfaces by leveraging modern Fortran features such as BIND(C) and ISO_C_BINDING along with annotation strategies to reduce the need of manual generation of interfaces. The improved system will enhance both usability for end-users and maintainability for developers.",

          "description": "Traditionally, brain activity has been analyzed independently from peripheral physiological measurements like the electrocardiogram (ECG), but our understanding of brain-heart interactions (BHI) has significantly evolved since then: we now know that not only does the brain modulate the heart but surprisingly the heart exerts a powerful influence on the brain. For example, the timing of a learning task relative to the cycle of the heartbeat modulates its event-related potential (ERP), and heart-beats interact with activity in the insula, an area critically involved in internal monitoring. However, despite this increased interest in BHI in the neuroscientific community, there is a lack of well-documented tool, that incorporates much of the modern BHI identification techniques, treats sensitively ECG artifacts, and furthermore complements modern brain connectivity analysis. BHI studies point to a much greater complexity in neural signals that current connectivity packages fail to account for, such as recent work pointing to the modulating of brain oscillations by respiration. As such, this project has two main purposes: extract BHI and direct respiratory modulation of the brain and build a brain connectivity tool that accounts for these confounding measures, built in the Python MNE environment to complement traditional data analysis pipelines. Our analysis functions will furthermore be validated through tutorial-like experiments, written as Jupyter notebooks on open datasets, and we hope that the results I show will convince the scientific audience of the importance of confounding peripheral measures in neural data.  \n\nThe minimal set of deliverables include: individual analysis functions for peripheral physiological signals, connectivity measures between peripheral and neural signals, and brain connectivity measures, both regular, and conditioned on peripheral physiological signals to remove their effect, and experiments demonstrating these tools on open datasets.",

The solution involves refactoring cells_default.py for dynamic cell creation, modifying network.py to handle arbitrary cell types, and updating related components to support custom cell types.\n\nThe proposed plan includes dynamic cell type implementation, updated network connectivity handling, a demonstration model with custom cell types, comprehensive documentation, and unit tests ensuring backward compatibility.

The project will also integrate GestureCap with MaxMSP and Ableton Live, making it more accessible to musicians and producers. Further improvements will focus on latency reduction, real-time inference optimizations, and testing OpenPose-based feature extraction as a potential enhancement.

Subsequently, EvolveGCN, a model known for its ability to handle evolving graph structures, will be applied and potentially adapted to capture the dynamic nature of these developmental processes. The expected outcomes include a functional implementation within the DevoGraph repository, a model capable of explaining key aspects of C. elegans development, and valuable insights into the efficacy of temporal graph techniques for addressing this complex biological problem.

          "description": "This project aims to replace Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) methods with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for inference problems involving complex or intractable likelihood functions, such as those in Virtual Brain Inference (VBI). While SBI uses deep networks to approximate posterior distributions, it can introduce hard-to-control biases and limit interpretability. In contrast, MCMC provides a more principled Bayesian approach by directly sampling from the posterior. A key challenge in using MCMC methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is their need for differentiable likelihoods, which are often unavailable in high-dimensional models like those for fMRI, EEG, or MEG data. This project addresses that issue by leveraging Automatic Differentiation (AD), which allows efficient gradient computation. Implemented in libraries like JAX, which enables fast, parallel computation on GPUs. The first goal is to translate existing Virtual Brain models - specifically the Montbrió model - into JAX. This model simulates brain dynamics and links simulated EEG BOLD dynamics to fMRI observations. Its parameters, currently estimated via SBI, will instead be inferred using MCMC for improved accuracy and scalability. Reparameterization strategies and hierarchical structures will be used to enhance MCMC performance and convergence. Deliverables include a JAX-based translation of the Montbrió model, implementation of MCMC-based inference, reparameterization strategies, benchmarking against SBI methods, and application to real neuroimaging data. The outcome will offer more robust tools for understanding neural dynamics and disorders, improving the accuracy and interpretability of brain models.",

          "description": "This project proposes to modernize DRuntime by converting legacy runtime hooks (functions that implement high-level language constructs like array operations and associative arrays) into compile-time templates. These hooks currently rely on dynamic type resolution via TypeInfo, introducing overhead that limits optimization opportunities. By leveraging D’s template metaprogramming, this work will enable compile-time specialization of these operations, improving runtime performance, potentially reducing binary sizes, and simplifying DRuntime maintenance. To achieve all this, my proposed solution comprises of three systematic steps for each hook: \n1. Template implementation: Rewriting the hook as a template function in DRuntime, replacing the runtime TypeInfo queries with compile-time type parameters.\n2. Compiler Integration: Modifying the DMD frontend to generate calls to the new templated hooks during the lowering phase.\n3.

This project aims to replace Twirl with a new template engine that supports both server- and client-side rendering, ensures better type safety, and allows developers to embed HTML directly into Scala code using standard HTML syntax.\n\nThe solution involves extending the Parsley parser combinator library to support interpolated strings, enabling dynamic splicing of Scala values into HTML templates. Building on this foundation, a context-free HTML parser will be implemented using Parsley, with output rendered as ScalaTags to support both client and server environments. To support larger applications, the project will also introduce standalone template files processed through an sbt source generator. If time permits, further enhancements such as compile-time parsing, efficient string rendering, and DOM diffing strategies will be explored.\n\nThe final result will consist of an integration of interpolated parsing into Parsley, Krop support for interpolated HTML snippets embedded into Scala, and Twirl-like standalone HTML templates.",

The Workflow4s Chat Toolkit solves this by providing a lightweight Scala library that abstracts these complexities behind a simple, unified interface.\n\nThe solution delivers:\n\nPlatform adapters with core messaging capabilities (send/receive)\n\nWorkflow4s integration points for chat-triggered automations\n\nType-safe Scala design using Futures and case classes\n\nMock testing environment for reliable development\n\nKey deliverables include:\n\nPhase 1: Slack MVP with basic messaging and workflow triggers\n\nPhase 2: Production-ready error handling and workflow actions\n\nPhase 3: Extensible architecture documentation and multi-platform support\n\nThe toolkit significantly reduces integration overhead, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than API specifics. By implementing this as a prototype first, we validate the approach while laying foundation for future expansion to richer interactions like file sharing and threaded conversations.

          "description": "This project tackles the lack of transparency in tree-planting initiatives by developing a decentralized mobile application that leverages blockchain technology for verifiable and tamper-proof tracking. Each planted tree is minted as an NFT (ERC-721), storing critical metadata like geolocation, species, and planter details on-chain. To ensure authenticity, the system incorporates a community-driven verification mechanism where users can validate trees by submitting photo proofs stored on IPFS, earning tokenized rewards (ERC-20) for their participation. A key innovation is the use of geohash-based indexing, which optimizes location queries by dynamically adjusting precision based on map zoom levels, significantly reducing gas costs and improving performance. The app features an interactive map built with Flutter, displaying nearby trees with species-specific icons and enabling users to explore detailed records.\n\nTo address the issue of tree mortality, the project introduces legacy tokens—ERC-20 rewards distributed to planters who report deceased trees or submit maintenance updates like care photos and videos. Tree NFTs are transferable, with ancestry tracked to maintain historical records. For collective efforts, smart contract-based organizational tools allow groups to manage plantations, add members, and track contributions on-chain. Additionally, each tree is linked to a dynamic QR code stored on IPFS, enabling physical trees to be scanned for instant access to their digital records. By combining blockchain transparency, geospatial efficiency, and community incentives, this project establishes a scalable and trustless framework for global reforestation efforts.",

It also misses opportunities for reuse of scan data and lacks user-level attribution and secure token handling. This project and proposal aims to refactor and extend SW360's FOSSology integration by utilizing the modern RESTful API (OpenAPI v2 spec) offered by FOSSology. It will enable advanced functionalities such as:\n1. Direct Source Uploads via POST /uploads\n2. Checksum-Based Search and Reuse using /filesearch\n3. Selectable Scanning Agents (e.g., Nomos, Monk, Reuser)\n4. Multi-Format Report Generation (SPDX, CycloneDX, etc.)\n5. User-Specific Token Support for secure and auditable API interactions\nThese enhancements will be implemented through a modular, secure, and scalable API integration layer in SW360, with robust error handling, polling mechanisms, and extensibility for future API versions.\nDeliverables:\n1. REST API Refactoring of SW360's FOSSology connector using modern v2 endpoints.\n2. Efficient File Upload System with token-based authentication and job initiation.\n3. Checksum Reuse Logic to avoid duplicate scans and utilize FOSSology’s “Reuser” agent.\n4. Configurable Scanning Agent Support exposed via backend APIs.\n5. Support for Diverse Report Formats, download mechanisms, and metadata linking.\n6. Secure Token Management for both server-wide and user-specific workflows.\n7.

Currently, to feed text into models like GPT-2 or GPT-3, users must rely on external libraries (e.g. tiktoken) for tokenization. My project will create a built-in tokenizer utility—implemented in C++ with Python bindings—that can convert raw text into token IDs and decode model outputs back into text.  \n\nThe core deliverable is a new cv::dnn::Tokenizer class supporting Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), along with the ability to load typical vocabulary/merges files and handle special tokens. Once implemented, this will allow a seamless pipeline for text-based or multimodal models within OpenCV: raw text -> tokens -> DNN inference -> tokens -> decoded text. I will also write comprehensive documentation and test this functionality against known tokenizer outputs (e.g., Hugging Face), ensuring correctness and good performance.  \n\nBy adding native tokenization, OpenCV’s DNN module becomes more versatile for cutting-edge AI tasks involving both vision and language. This reduces external dependencies, makes it easier to deploy LLMs in pure C++ or Python environments, and helps unify image and text processing in a single library—further strengthening OpenCV as a comprehensive open-source toolkit.",

In particular, in order of approximate importance:\n\n    Auto white balance: implement FFCC\n    Chromatic aberration correction: implement algorithm of Chang et al.\n    Denoising: implement a CNN-based method as a module like dnn_superres\n    Exposure correction: implement (Adaptive, Weighted) Gamma Correction\n    Superresolution: check if any additional newer models for superresolution could be added\n\nIf I am accepted as a contributor in GSOC, I expect to pursue 2-3 of these topics in-depth to fit in the timeframe of the medium-sized project (~175 hours).

In particular, it lacks compatibility with quantization schemes widely used for CPU-friendly LLM inference.\n\nThe goal is to enable the complete LLM inference pipeline within OpenCV: importing models via the GGUF format, implementing session-based runtime caching, adding support for low-bit quantized models, and exposing the functionality through clean Python bindings.",

          "description": "This project involves a methodological approach to developing, testing, and documenting a SLAM framework, extending the current OpenCV's SFM(structure-for-motion) module. This will serve as both a practical tool for robotics applications and an educational resource for computer vision researchers. The project will culminate by integrating a fully functional SLAM framework in OpenCV with comprehensive documentation, enabling future extensions and adaptations by the broader computer vision community.\n\nTraditional SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) pipelines can fail in low-texture settings or with erratic motion, while naïve deep-learning usage often demands powerful GPUs. Our proposal addresses these shortcomings by integrating LightGlue (a neural network-based feature matching framework) and ALIKED (a learned keypoint extractor) into a streamlined SLAM system that retains real-time feasibility on modest hardware. This combination improves accuracy by reducing drift—a common issue in purely classical systems. Meanwhile, we handle the SLAM back end (bundle adjustment, pose graph optimization) in C++, leveraging libraries like Ceres Solver for real-time performance.\n\nThe project will unfold in two primary phases. Phase 1 focuses on building a Visual Odometry pipeline: feature extraction and matching, pose estimation, and basic mapping. Phase 2 expands this pipeline into a fully-fledged SLAM system by adding loop closure, global pose graph optimization, and map refinement. Together, these steps ensure global consistency and minimize drift over longer trajectories.\n\nKey deliverables include:\n   - Working SLAM pipeline with ALIKED + LightGlue for feature processing.\n   - Benchmarking and comparison on standard datasets (e.g., KITTI, Malaga), demonstrating quantitative improvements.\n    - Documentation and code that enable easy adoption or extension for other robotics or vision applications.",

          "description": "I propose to work on the following project: porting the Chebfun package to GNU Octave. Chebfun is a numerical computation package for MATLAB that provides a framework for representing functions in a symbolic manner using ”Chebyshev technology”, a term coined by the package authors to describe the use of Chebyshev polynomials to represent functions up to machine precision. GNU Octave is supposed to be mostly compatible with MATLAB, so Chebfun should ideally work without change on the former, but there are some slight differences and unimplemented features in Octave that make this difficult. Primarily, the main issue is that Octave’s support for object-oriented programming (classdef) is not as feature complete and as stable as MATLAB’s, which is a major problem since Chebfun is written in classdef.\n\n The goal of this project is to port Chebfun to GNU Octave, and to make it work as a dropin replacement for the MATLAB version. Since fixing classdef is not a feasible/recommended goal for a GSoC project, I will instead focus primarily on making the necessary changes to the Chebfun codebase to make it work in Octave. Along the way, I will compile new information about the status of classdef in Octave, and I will share my findings with the Octave developers, and perhaps aid in some changes to the Octave codebase itself.",

          "description": "OpenStreetMap (OSM) commonly stores names of streets, places, and points of interest in their local language and script. As a result, users searching in unfamiliar regions may receive results that are unreadable—especially when those names are rendered in non-Latin scripts like Cyrillic, Arabic, or Chinese. This project will enhance Nominatim, OSM’s geocoding engine, by adding transliteration support to its search results.\n\nThe goal is to detect when names are in a script unfamiliar to the user and provide a readable transliteration alongside the original. This involves detecting the script of place names, selecting an appropriate transliteration library (e.g., pyicu, unidecode), and integrating a new transliterated_name field into Nominatim’s output format. The solution will be designed to be modular and extensible to multiple languages and target scripts.\n\nDeliverables include a working transliteration pipeline, user-configurable options, improved search result formatting, robust test coverage, and complete documentation. This will make OpenStreetMap data more accessible to users worldwide by bridging language and script barriers during location search.",

          "description": "The iD Editor is a powerful tool used by thousands to contribute to OpenStreetMap, but its current session management system relies on localStorage, which poses several usability and technical challenges. With a small 5MB storage limit and synchronous behavior that blocks the main thread, users often face sluggish performance and occasional data loss. These issues become even more pronounced when users work across multiple browser tabs, where localStorage provides no real synchronization, leading to conflicts and inconsistent states between sessions.\n\nThis project proposes to modernize session management in iD by adopting IndexedDB for efficient, large-scale, and non-blocking data storage. A key focus will be enabling real-time multi-tab editing support using the BroadcastChannel API to keep changes synchronized across tabs without clobbering data. The project will also improve crash resilience, ensure safe cleanup of resources using modern browser lifecycle events like pagehide, and introduce a graceful fallback for older browsers. Together, these improvements aim to make iD more robust, responsive, and aligned with modern web standards while keeping the editing experience reliable and smooth for all contributors.",

          "description": "This project focuses on end-to-end Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for early modern Spanish manuscripts. Unlike traditional OCR systems, which process isolated characters or lines, end-to-end HTR captures entire documents, preserving not only the text but also structural elements such as layout and reading order. Although this approach holds significant promise for both research and practical applications, it remains underexplored, especially for historical texts.\n\nThis project proposes to apply end-to-end HTR techniques to early modern Spanish manuscripts, a historically rich yet computationally challenging corpus. Leveraging recent advances in deep learning. The project aims to improve recognition accuracy on handwritten and printed texts from this period by building on models which focus on document-wide attention mechanisms, the system will be able to better handle complex layouts and diverse handwriting styles typical of early modern Spanish texts.\n\nUltimately, this research sits at the intersection of machine learning and historical document analysis, contributing both to technical innovation and cultural preservation. By improving the accessibility of early Spanish documents, the project not only supports scholars in the humanities but also contributes to the growing field of AI-driven humanities research. The integration of cutting-edge HTR models into historical workflows can open new possibilities for indexing, searching, and analyzing large volumes of archival material in a scalable, automated fashion.",

However, existing OCR tools like Adobe Acrobat and Google’s Pytesseract, they struggle with historical documents due to variations in font styles, image quality, degradation, and layouts. Text recognition from centuries-old works poses a significant challenge due to the complexity of early non-standard print forms, handwritten text and manuscripts.\nOver the past year, transformer-based models have been fine-tuned to improve transcription accuracy, particularly for degraded and complex historical texts. Training on a diverse dataset that combines expert transcriptions and synthetic data has enabled better generalization across various typographical styles.\nBuilding on this progress, we aim to expand the dataset, to help the model finetune to handle handwritten documents as well. Fine-tuning on larger datasets incorporating diverse typographical styles both printed and handwritten and also implementing Language Modeling & Contextual Understanding for post-processing, allowing for  contextual corrections based on 17th-century grammar to further enhancing the OCR accuracy. Additionally, we plan to develop and deploy a web or mobile-based annotation tool for historians, researchers, and institutions to validate and refine OCR outputs",

By leveraging 3D scans of the fragments and training models on real geometric descriptors, the system will predict correct alignments and reassemble the stele in a digital space.

          "description": "My project will implement, compare, and ultimately combine two complementary approaches to software defect prediction: the BugCache/FixCache algorithm and the Reconstruction Error Probability Distribution (REPD) model. Building on my preliminary research across Java repositories including OpenJ9 and OpenJDK, I will first revive and enhance BugTools to implement the BugCache algorithm, which predicts defects based on historical patterns. I will then implement the REPD model, which uses code metrics and reconstruction error to identify potentially defective code.\n\nAfter evaluating both implementations independently across multiple Eclipse codebases, I will develop a novel hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both methods. This integrated solution will combine BugCache's temporal pattern recognition with REPD's code characteristic analysis, using a dynamic weighting system that adapts to each repository's unique characteristics. \n\nThe final outcome will be an integrated verification workflow (GlitchWitcher) that runs these analyses against repositories and pull requests, providing a unified prediction model that flags areas needing increased testing and review attention. This tool will provide developers with early, accurate warnings about potentially defective code before it undergoes testing or review, ultimately improving software quality and development efficiency.",

This project will transform the developer experience by providing real-time insights into application performance, protocol behavior, and system health, ultimately leading to more reliable and maintainable IoT solutions.\n\nI've structured my approach into three interconnected layers: the Core Layer integrates OpenTelemetry directly into node-wot to standardize telemetry collection; the Infrastructure Layer enhances Docker Compose configurations with health checks and observability backends; and the Monitoring Layer provides actionable insights through custom dashboards and alerts. Drawing from my experience with AWS services, Azure Monitor, and containerization technologies, I'm confident I can deliver a solution that addresses the unique challenges of IoT observability.

However, INP lacks granularity, making it difficult for developers to diagnose and address specific latency issues within different stages of event processing and rendering.\n\nSolution Approach:\nTo enhance the diagnostic capabilities of INP, this proposal suggests breaking down the INP metric into its sub-dimensions—input delay, processing time, and presentation delay—by leveraging modifications to Chromium’s Event Timing API. These fine-grained timestamps will be transmitted from the Renderer process to the Browser process via Mojo IPC, eventually integrating these metrics into the UKM metric system and CrUX experimental dataset. The project will involve updating the PageLoadMetricsSender to include detailed timing data for each event, as well as enhancing the UkmPageLoadMetricsObserver to handle both old and new data formats seamlessly.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n1. Prototype Verification: Establish a proof-of-concept for collecting sub-dimension data using Chromium’s debugging environment.\n2. Mojo Protocol Modification: Extend existing IPC interfaces to support new subpart timings.\n3. UKM Integration: Implement new UKM metrics reporting and update relevant configurations.\n4. Test Suite Development: Develop comprehensive tests including Web Platform Tests/WPT cases and unit test coverage.\n5. Performance Regression Testing: Analyze benchmark reports and memory usage to ensure no negative impact on performance.\n6.

Currently, there are some units which might be missing coverage across the web platform test repository and the Chromium build. Our aim is to implement new tests for better coverage and reduce flakiness. Making better tests will reduce that ambiguity and ensure the proper working of the FedCM API. In the process of completing this project, a 100% green dashboard on wpt.fyi will further solidify the standard of tests developed and fixed for the Chromium browser family,\n\nTest Coverage: Comparing the Federated Credential Management API tests with the test suite provided by both, the Chromium project and the Web Platform Tests. Includes compilation of currently untested units.\n\nTest Migration: Migrating internal Chromium tests to external/wpt benefits cross-browser compatibility and standardization. This means adhering to the standard set by WPT and working on clearing all the errors for Chrome on the wpt.fyi dashboard. Another benefit is that Chromium based browsers can use migrated tests instead of starting from scratch while developing tests compatible with their browser.\n\nNew Tests: Writing WPT compatible tests in HTML, JavaScript and Python. It will simulate user actions while interacting with Federated Credential Management flows. This includes all the errors which may be caused due to some unprecedented user action, or edge cases where the Identity Provider faces trouble while sending tokens to the Relying Party. Simulating such scenarios will help provide better coverage and make better tests. Another idea would be communicating with people who faced issues regarding the FedCM API in the Chromium community.\n\nReduction of Flakiness: Reducing test flakiness is essential to increase trust in the test suites provided by Chromium and can be done by categorizing whether a flaky test should be removed entirely, flagged as platform-specific error, or by modifying the Test Expectation file.",

          "description": "This project enhances the farfetchd service in ChromiumOS by adding support for tracing and replaying disk I/O during application startup. The goal is to log system-level disk accesses (at the memory page level) during an application's execution using Linux’s tracefs, and store these traces in a structured format. These traces can then be used to proactively preload data into memory before the application launches, significantly reducing cold start latency.\n\nThe project includes building a tracing API, a replay mechanism using mmap(), a D-Bus interface for triggering prefetching, and validation through startup performance measurement. A tast-based test will demonstrate the measurable performance gain using Chromium as a target application.",

This redundancy not only complicates maintenance but also adds unnecessary bulk to Chromium’s continuous integration pipeline. To address this, the proposed project will systematically replace audit.js with testharness.js across all affected tests. The transition will streamline testing practices, align them with international web standards, and enhance the efficiency of the testing process. Deliverables include a detailed triage of the existing tests, rewriting them for compatibility with testharness.js, and fully removing audit.js from the codebase.

Currently, over 300 audio-related test files rely on an old helper library called audit.js. While useful in the past, this library is now outdated and duplicates many features already provided by the more modern and standardized W3C testing framework, testharness.js.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to modernize these tests by replacing audit.js with testharness.js, which is better supported and more efficient. I will also create a lightweight audio-specific helper tool to ensure that any necessary features from the old library are preserved. This work involves JavaScript debugging, writing clean and maintainable test code, and aligning with W3C standards.\r\n\r\nBy streamlining and modernizing Chromium’s web audio tests, this project will improve testing efficiency and reduce technical debt in one of the most widely used browser engines in the world.

This will be achieved through JSON-based storage for local configurations and database integration for server-side persistence. Users will have the option to enable or disable view restoration via a new setting, ensuring flexibility.\nSecond, the project will introduce a collaborative view-sharing feature through a dedicated \"Manage View\" widget. This will enable participants in an operation to share, browse, and load predefined layouts, ensuring consistency during joint missions. The widget will integrate with MSS’s existing operation system, allowing real-time updates via WebSocket notifications.

          "description": "The project involves integrating pixel size support into ilastik, an image-processing and classification tool. Pixel size is a metadata item enabling conversion of image pixels into real-world measurements. \nWhilst pixel size is not currently processed in ilastik image sets, the program is used extensively in scientific applications, and introducing real-world measurements would enable development of several key features that would allow more in-depth quantitative analysis of image data, such as object displacement and velocity in video tracking, and real-world area calculation of segmentations/ volume calculation of carvings.\n\nOnce the metadata is extracted at the image input end, it is possible to feed it directly into the data pipeline, so it can be picked back up within any relevant workflow. This facilitates feature development, as it then becomes possible to work directly with the metadata values within the workflow. Once the backends of these features have been developed, they will be implemented on the front-end via Qt.\n\nThe key deliverables of this project are:\n Implement pixel size metadata into workflows, such that the metadata remains present in project files, output images, and exported datasets; \nEnable calculating areas of image segmentations; \nEnable calculating volumes of image carvings; \nEnable recording of object displacement in video tracking; \nEnable measurement of object velocity in video tracking; \nProduce detailed and well-written documentation, and ensure  relevant test scripts for each feature are made available.

Vorta provides a user-friendly desktop GUI for Borg, while Borgmatic serves as a command-line interface for managing backups. This proposal outlines four projects designed to improve the functionality, security, and usability of both Vorta and Borgmatic. \n\nFor the first project aims to add a new feature to the Vorta GUI that lets users change their repository passphrase. Changing a Borg repository passphrase is a feature that’s often requested but hasn’t been fully implemented yet within Vorta.  This would make security management more accessible and eliminate the need for users to use Borg directly for such tasks. \n\nThe second project aims to develop a custom file selector with PyQt6 FileDialog, which will handle multiple file and directory selections in one window. At the moment, Vorta has separate dialogs for selecting files and directories. This allows users to select both files and directories in a single window.\n\nThe third project aims to introduce a much-needed improvement by adding a file selector dialog that allows users to pick files and directories to exclude directly through the UI. Right now, users who want to exclude certain files or directories from their backup have to manually type in paths or use patterns. This will allow users to eliminate the need for manual match expressions and reducing errors. \n\nThe final project aims on wrapping a few missing Borg subcommands into Borgmatic actions, so users can perform these tasks directly through Borgmatic without needing to use Borg’s CLI. These additions will make Borgmatic more comprehensive, \nreducing the need for users to jump between tools to perform essential tasks.\n\nThese enhancements will make Vorta and Borgmatic user-friendly and feature-complete, ultimately improving the quality of backup process for users across different platforms.",

Starting from a genome, these reconstructions are developed using annotations, biochemical data, and information from scientific literature. This can make GENREs strain-specific. From these networks, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are derived, serving as powerful tools for exploring bacterial systems. Biologically grounded constraints can be applied to these models, resulting in constraint-based models that can predict the flow of metabolites through a defined network with techniques such as Flux Balance Analysis, Flux Variability Analysis and Flux Sampling. However, a common challenge in solutions derived from such models is the occurrence of thermodynamically infeasible loops (or internal cycles), which lead to nonbiological fluxes in simulation results.

          "description": "GNOME Papers (formerly Evince) currently processes all documents within a single application process, creating significant security and stability risks. A vulnerability or crash in one document can compromise the entire application. This project aims to create a proof-of-concept for backend isolation by implementing a multi-process architecture where each document runs in a separate process. The approach involves researching process isolation models (e.g., WebKit, Chromium), designing an IPC mechanism using D-Bus and shared memory, and implementing basic sandboxing for document processes. Key deliverables include a working prototype demonstrating isolation for at least one document format (e.g., PDF), performance and security analysis, and comprehensive documentation to guide future implementation. This project addresses long-standing limitations blocking features like tabbed interfaces while improving security and stability for GNOME Papers users.",

This will allow me to see best practices and common syntax used. At the same time, I will research how Vala currently parses and emits JSON, XML, and YAML formats. Lastly, out of the research, I will know how to properly integrate the format languages into Vala's compiler which will allow for direct syntax integration.\n\nThe overall deliverables consist of: 1) Research on how Vala and other programming languages handle JSON, XML, and YAML. 2) Syntax design and mock-ups. 3) Implementation and prototyping. 4) Testing, documentation, and code snippets",

Currently, Sysprof relies on accessing numerous /proc files, which involves frequent syscalls, file descriptor operations, and context switches, creating performance bottlenecks. By utilizing eBPF, data collection can be done directly within the kernel, eliminating the need for constant /proc access and minimizing context switches. This approach not only lowers overhead but also ensures consistent and atomic data capture. eBPF also allows for advanced features such as system-wide syscall monitoring and process creation tracking, which were difficult to implement previously. By adopting eBPF, Sysprof becomes more efficient, scalable, and feature-rich, laying the foundation for future enhancements and transforming it into a modern, versatile profiling tool.",

          "description": "smartmontools (smartctl) is a widely used tool for collecting SMART metrics from storage devices (SATA, SAS, NVMe). However, its runtime metadata file, drivedb.h, suffers from inconsistent labeling of attributes such as SSD wear level, which hinders meaningful data analysis and monitoring. These inconsistencies make it challenging to integrate smartctl metrics into observability tools used in Ceph and other environments.\n\nThis project proposes a two-part solution. First, I will add an interpretation primitive in smartmontools’ C++ codebase to handle transformations such as converting wear remaining to wear used (e.g., 100 - value). Second, I will develop a regex-based postprocessor tool to normalize and map freeform SMART attribute labels from drivedb.h to a consistent and defined set. This tool will help standardize outputs and facilitate reliable data ingestion for observability dashboards.\n\nDeliverables include:\n\nInterpretation logic enhancement in the smartmontools C++ source\n\nA standalone normalization tool (in Python, Go, or C++)\n\nDocumentation and guidelines for community usage and extension\n\nOptional test suite to validate attribute normalization",

Accurate and efficient numerical solvers are essential for these simulations to predict correct behaviour.

However, LSODA’s widely used implementations are primarily in C/C++ and Fortran, creating a barrier for researchers working in Java-based environments.

Thus, this project aims to develop a Python package to automate the creation of datasets from data in SynBioHub. In doing so, we will first upload data from previous research to SynBioHub, create the package that returns data from SynBioHub in a format suitable for machine learning models, test the package on the data that was uploaded, explore the performance of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on the data, and thoroughly document the package.",

It will include:\n- Implementing semantic accessibility wrappers\n- Ensuring proper focus and navigation flow\n- Enhancing screen reader feedback using Orca\n- Improving the accessibility of complex UI components, such as partitioning\n- Conducting extensive user testing and providing detailed documentation\n\nDeliverables\n- A fully accessible Ubuntu installer with complete screen reader compatibility\n- Keyboard-navigable UI with audio cues and meaningful semantic labels\n- Documentation and developer guidelines for future accessibility improvements\n- Tested integration with Accessible-Coconut 24.04\n\nThis project will enable independent system installation for visually impaired users and contribute long-term value to Flutter-Linux accessibility efforts and the broader open-source community.",

          "description": "I will build an accessible AI support agent for Zendalona product.. This project addresses a critical gap in accessibility support by creating a conversational interface that seamlessly accepts both voice and text input, allowing users to interact naturally with Zendalona's product ecosystem.\nThe technical architecture employs an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using LlamaIndex. This system will methodically index all Zendalona product information, documentation, and support materials in a vector database (ChromaDB or FAISS). When users submit queries, the system retrieves contextually relevant information and passes it to a large language model alongside the query, enabling precise, helpful responses based on accurate product knowledge.\nThe implementation follows a three-tier approach: First, a comprehensive data ingestion pipeline that processes, cleans, and vectorizes Zendalona's product information. Second, a robust Python backend built with FastAPI that handles query processing, context retrieval, and response generation through integration with STT/TTS services and LLM APIs. Third, a fully accessible React-based multimodal chat interface featuring high-contrast text, complete keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and seamless screen reader compatibility, particularly with Orca.\nKey deliverables include a modular, containerized system with separate frontend and backend Docker containers orchestrated via Docker Compose, comprehensive API documentation, extensive accessibility testing results, and detailed user guides. The solution prioritizes WCAG 2.2 compliance, minimal latency, data privacy, and security throughout the architecture. The final product will provide visually impaired users with an intuitive, conversational way to access product support that works effectively with their existing assistive technologies.",

          "description": "The Android version of World-Map-Explorer aims to leverage its existing web platform by integrating a web view, enabling direct reuse of features and functionalities from the web version, which is optimized for keyboard and screen reader accessibility. The primary challenge lies in adapting accessibility for mobile users, replacing keyboard navigation with an intuitive gesture-based system that mirrors the web experience. To ensure seamless usability, this gesture system must activate exclusively when TalkBack is enabled, requiring a custom accessibility service to override TalkBack’s default behavior and prioritize app-specific gestures. Developing this service demands meticulous planning to handle all potential interruptions (e.g., notifications, calls) while maintaining smooth app operation. Additionally, sighted users should experience a conventional interface akin to mainstream map apps like Google Maps, necessitating a dual design approach: the gesture system remains invisible unless accessibility features are active. Success hinges on balancing robust gesture detection, reliable event management, and preserving a familiar UI for non-TalkBack users, ensuring universal accessibility without compromising usability.",

The core focus is on developing a flexible framework that allows researchers to analyze simulation data with greater precision and lower overhead. One of the main components, the Stats Collection, will enable users to define exactly which statistics they want to track—such as mean, max, or count—helping reduce both memory usage and computation time.\n\nAnother key feature is the Event Driven Collection, which records data only when predefined conditions are met. This ensures researchers capture meaningful insights while avoiding unnecessary logging and storage. To support even larger simulations, the project will also include integration with external storage systems like PostgreSQL and S3, allowing collected data to be streamed directly to disk or the cloud.\n\nIn addition to these core improvements, the project will focus on performance optimization through lazy execution with Polars and better vectorization.

          "description": "A lot of work has been done to parallelize the Rust compiler frontend, with notable success in code generation and some post-HIR lowering stages. Other critical components, such as lexical parsing and macro expansion, are still implemented serially. Macro expansion is fundamental in Rust, enabling code generation at compile-time based on patterns and user-defined rules in the source code itself. However, due to dependencies between macros and the strict ordering of name resolution, its inherently sequential nature poses a significant challenge for parallelization.\nCurrently, macro expansion and import resolution are tightly coupled and executed sequentially, making parallel execution difficult. This project aims to develop a parallel and order-independent algorithm for these two processes, improving compiler performance while maintaining correctness. Addressing the dependencies and execution order constraints could significantly reduce compilation time and enhance the compiler's overall compilation speed.",

This approach will require less auditing, will enhance the build transparency and reduce the compile-time overhead.\n\nBuild scripts in Rust facilitate compiling and linking 3rd party code, such as existing C/C++ libraries, before building a package. They are immensely important for interoperability since it prevents replacing/rewriting the already existing tools that are well-optimized for their tasks. \n\nHowever, the current build system has certain limitations. Only one build script is allowed per package, and it must be run before building the package, often causing unnecessary computation (e.g., during unit tests). Single Large script needs extra auditing, increase compile-time, and reduce transparency for third-party build tools, especially while passing parameters. They also cannot run unit tests within themselves.\n\nThis project aims to overcome the above limitations by allowing multiple, well-organized build scripts that can be run directly from the Cargo.toml. These scripts are optional and run only when required, avoiding unnecessary expensive logic. With this, only the shared build scripts will need auditing. This approach enhances build transparency, reduces compile-time overhead, and even enables unit testing of build scripts if they are treated as a dedicated package.",

Communication occurs via a unidirectional JSON-RPC interface, with the client sending requests and the server responding. \n\nHowever, this design has drawbacks: bulky JSON serialization introduces significant overhead due to deeply nested data structures, and the unidirectional messaging model limits certain proc-macro APIs that require the server to request additional information from the client. This constraint is a major obstacle to implementing new proc-macro APIs.\n\nI plan to overcome these limitations by:\n\n1. Adopting Postcard, a binary serialization format which is a more  compact and efficient alternative to JSON.\n2. Implementing bidirectional communication between the client and server, enabling the server to ask for additional data from the client during execution.\n3.

          "description": "The crate cargo-semver-checks provides feedback to user based on what possible breaking changes they may have made, which as per semantic versioning may require that the user accordingly update the semantic version of their library. This ensures that major breaking changes do not occur without notice. However, the feedback from cargo-semver-checks is not always the easiest to understand, in that whatever problem may actually be present is not always obvious. Additionally, cargo-semver-checks sometimes suffers from false-positive, where it detects a breaking change where there is none. \n\nThis project proposes to remedy many of these issues by leveraging the existing lint data to implement so-called \"witness programs\", which are designed to demonstrate the breaking change by compiling successfully on a baseline version of the crate being tested, but failing to compile on the new version, due to the error caused by the breaking change.\n\nThe plan is, following some research at the start, to implement a basic witness system that allows for additional internal queries and generation of a witness program from a template. Following that, implement automated testing of these witness programs to verify they do fail when expected. In the event of an unexpected behaviour, the system should be designed to provide the user with diagnostic information and an easy way to submit an issue to the cargo-semver-checks team. Lastly, these witness program templates then need to be written en masse, utilizing the now created system to provide these witness programs to as many lints as possible. Ideally, by the end of the Google Summer of Code program, 80% of the current lints should have witness program templates. \n\nAdditionally, it is planned to continuously engage with the Rust community so as to both inform members of the progress of this proposal, but also to encourage accountability over the process of developing this project.",

Traditional floating-point methods often introduce numerical errors, which can result in incorrect or unstable path operations. Interval arithmetic enables us to compute guaranteed bounds for intersections, handle edge cases more robustly, and ensure greater numerical stability. These improved routines will also serve as a foundation for constructing a guaranteed planar graph, supporting advanced features such as boolean operations and path offsetting.",

The core problem is that while camera-based visual odometry can struggle in certain environments and LiDAR systems are often too heavy and expensive for all UAVs, there is not a reliable way for lightweight UAVs to leverage the high-accuracy 3D maps generated by more capable mapping systems.\n\nThe proposed solution is to develop a framework that allows UAVs with 3D cameras to utilize pre-generated, centimeter-level 3D maps for navigation. This will involve a C++ based ROS2 package designed to run on a companion computer. This package will:\n\n1) Process the pre-generated maps.\n2) Implement point cloud matching algorithms (such as ICP and NDT) to align live camera scans with the existing map and compute a  (6 DOF) pose.\n3) Fuse the estimated pose with IMU data using an (EKF) to provide smooth and high-rate odometry, particularly improving Z-axis estimation.\n4) Incorporate a state machine to manage the odometry data, perform sanity checks, handle potential issues (like data rate drops, connection loss, time desynchronization, and corrupted messages), and transmit the validated pose to the UAV's firmware via MAVLink messages over serial communication.\n\nThe key deliverables of this project include:\n1) Fully functional prototype of the system in simulation capable of generating maps and using them to generate 6-DOF estimates using 3D camera\n2)Algorithm Design, Implementation, and Sensor Fusion\n3)System Integration, Validation, and Documentation\n4) Fully functional hardware setup.",

Currently, Faust does not officially support CLAP as a target architecture.\n\nThe goal is to extend the existing faust2xx framework by implementing a CLAP architecture file and a new command-line utility, faust2clap. This will allow developers to compile Faust DSP code into fully functional CLAP plugins, supporting advanced features such as per-note modulation and sample-accurate automation.\n\nDeliverables include the tool itself, a reusable architecture backend, a suite of test plugins, and comprehensive documentation. The project has been developed in close collaboration with the Faust team and aims to be merged upstream as an official component of the Faust toolchain.\n\nBy bridging Faust and CLAP, this project supports open plugin standards, expands deployment options for DSP developers, and modernises the Faust ecosystem.",

However, most optimized kernel implementations still live in the vendor-specific package they were written for, leaving the other packages to either reimplement their own version, use the current unoptimized fallback implementation from GPUArrays.jl, or in many cases, the operation is not supported.\n\nThis project aims to rewrite these optimized operations in GPUArrays.jl using the KernelAbstractions interface to improve performance and functionality for all GPU backends at once.

          "description": "JuliaBUGS is a modern Julia implementation of the classic Bayesian Inference using Gibbs Sampling — BUGS language for Bayesian modeling, combining BUGS’s intuitive model specification with Julia’s high-performance sampling methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. This project proposes a browser-based graphical model editor for JuliaBUGS, enabling users to visually construct probabilistic graphical models by adding nodes and drawing arrows, instead of writing code. Built using React with TypeScript and React Flow, the web interface will support adding, connecting, grouping, and editing random variables and deterministic nodes via an interactive canvas. Users can specify probability distributions and hyperparameters through intuitive forms. The editor will export model structures to JSON and generate valid JuliaBUGS (or BUGS) code. The GSoC project will focus entirely on delivering a polished, user-friendly frontend with clear usage examples and tutorials. Inspired by tools like DoodleBUGS (for WinBUGS or MultiBUGS), shinystan, and the R Package causact, this editor aims to make model specification more accessible and streamline the Bayesian modeling workflow.",

          "description": "This project aims to optimizing the MPI integration within Dagger.jl by first extending and improving the existing MPI.jl interface, documenting new interfaces, and refining the documentation for current ones. The second objective is to implement an efficient Remote Memory Access (RMA) communication strategy to replace traditional Point-to-Point methods. This change will help reduce memory and synchronization overhead and optimize data movement across distributed memory systems. Finally, to address the current O(M×N) complexity caused by the SIMD execution model, the project proposes a transition to a MIMD model using Multi-level Graph Partitioning. This approach will partition the execution Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into smaller, optimized subgraphs, significantly reducing redundant computations and enhancing parallel efficiency. To achieve these goals, we plan to conduct extensive benchmarking tests on the implementations. This will ensure the code is clear and well-documented, enabling future developers to use it freely.",

          "description": "This project strives to enhance the Input-Gen tool to extend coverage and compatibility with LLVM-supported languages, including C, C++, Julia, Rust, and Swift. By utilizing the LLVM ComPile dataset, a large amount of inputs can be generated and evaluated for determining the accuracy of the Input-Gen. Furthermore, numerical statistics can be gathered for determining the accuracy of the tool by numerical methods. Additionally, by installing the tool in a Debug configuration of LLVM, issues with the tool can be analyzed and documented. Successive development over the period of the standard GSoC timeline will allow the tool to be enhanced. Furthermore, the percentage of coverage, which can be defined as the successful instrumentation and execution of generated inputs from IR bitcode files or modules, will be expected to increase for the dataset from the previous 90% coverage. Ideal coverage is thus 100%, where all of the files are used as input to Input-Gen, which in return instruments the files so that they can be replayed and executed as a new file. New files created by Input-Gen can further be used as input to ML models or any testing mechanisms previously described. Thus, the goal of this project is to enhance the accuracy of the Input-Gen tool when executing with arbitrary IR files. This will then enable the tool to be adopted for practical purposes defined by LLVM developers.",

          "description": "The proposal outlines a project to migrate the management of omegaUp's public courses to GitHub, enabling open-source contributions and improving collaboration, version control, and deployment consistency. Currently, omegaUp's public courses are managed manually, which can be time-consuming and lacks community involvement. By using GitHub, contributors can submit pull requests (PRs) to update course content, which will be automatically validated and deployed using GitHub Actions and omegaUp's API.\n\nKey components of the project include:\n1. Course Migration: All public courses will be uploaded to a GitHub repository, structured by course and content type (lectures, problems, etc.).\n2. CI/CD Workflow: A GitHub Actions pipeline will validate and deploy updates when a PR is merged. This pipeline will automatically check for any changes in problems and deploy only the modified content.\n3. API Integration: The system will use omegaUp’s API to upload content after successful review and approval of changes.\n4. Community Collaboration: Contributors can suggest improvements via PRs, with a review process ensuring quality control before deployment.\n5. Automated Testing: The CI/CD pipeline will run validation scripts to check metadata, problem structure, and other course details before deployment.\n6. Security: A review and approval mechanism will prevent unauthorized or malicious content from being deployed.\n\nThe project aims to enhance omegaUp’s educational content by leveraging GitHub’s collaboration model, ensuring faster updates, better quality control, and reduced manual workload for omegaUp staff.\n\nA proof of concept has been set up in a sample GitHub repository, where contributors can simulate the entire workflow by submitting PRs and seeing automatic deployments on omegaUp.\n\nThis approach is expected to streamline course management, making it scalable and more responsive to community-driven improvements.",

          "description": "Currently, Cutter interacts with Rizin synchronously, meaning it directly calls Rizin functions and waits for a response. This approach leads to UI freezing when Rizin processes large files or complex inputs, making Cutter unresponsive until the operation is completed. Additionally, Cutter only pulls information from Rizin on demand and does not automatically detect changes made through plugins, the console widget, or other inputs. Since Rizin lacks a built-in event system, users must manually refresh the UI to reflect updates, which disrupts the workflow.\n\nThis project aims to introduce an event-driven interaction model between Cutter and Rizin to improve responsiveness and state synchronization. In the first phase, I will implement event notifications in Rizin, enabling it to signal relevant state changes. In the final phase, Cutter will be enhanced to react to these events, automatically refreshing its interface and supporting background analysis. These improvements will ensure a smoother user experience and eliminate the need for manual UI updates.\n\nBeyond solving these immediate issues, this work will lay the foundation for future scalability in the Rizin ecosystem. By transitioning to an event-driven model, Rizin will be better equipped to support multi-threading while maintaining seamless integration with Cutter. This will enhance efficiency, extensibility, and long-term maintainability, making the ecosystem more robust and user-friendly.

          "description": "PostgreSQL introduced Server API and ABI Stability Guidance to help extension authors understand compatibility expectations. The policy ensures ABI stability between minor releases (e.g., 17.0 to 17.1) but allows changes in major versions. Currently, committers rely on manual reviews to enforce this, which occasionally leads to unintended ABI changes. A recent example occurred in PostgreSQL 17.1, where an ABI-breaking change was shipped and later reversed in 17.2. This incident highlights the need for an automated process to catch such issues before release. To enforce ABI stability, this project will monitor PostgreSQL’s repository across branches, detecting any instability early. Since ABI changes depend on system architecture, OS, and compiler, the tool will be developed as an extension to PostgreSQL Build Farm, leveraging its infrastructure to handle diverse configurations. Git receive hooks are unsuitable as PostgreSQL does not allow them due to repository performance concerns. Instead, the build farm’s cron-based clients (animals) will store commit hashes locally and compare subsequent commits for ABI changes. The Libabigail suite (abidw, abidiff) will be used for ABI compliance checks, currently supporting GCC and Clang, with future expansion planned for other compilers. The system will generate ABI compliance reports for every commit, processed by the build farm server, which will be refactored to handle reports and update mailing logic to notify committers of breaking changes. This project will include the development of a Build Farm Client that generates ABI compliance reports per commit, a refactoring of the Build Farm Server to handle reports and update mailing logic, thorough testing to ensure stability before production deployment, and final deployment of the compliance checker by setting up the build farm client and server. This project will strengthen PostgreSQL’s ABI stability process, preventing unintended breakages and ensuring smoother updates.",

This project aims to enhance pgmoneta by adding advanced WAL filtering capabilities for targeted recovery, allowing users to preserve recent valid data while excluding specific operations, such as accidental DELETE queries or changes to certain tables. The proposed solution involves developing pgmoneta-walfilter, a command-line tool integrated into pgmoneta. This tool will enable users to define custom filtering rules in a YAML configuration file, processing WAL files from backups to omit unwanted operations during restoration.

The goal is to enable users to turn Cormas simulations into interactive, game-like experiences by detecting and tracking physical objects (such as game pieces) on a board and linking them to simulation agents.\n\nTo achieve this, I will develop a lightweight Python-based vision pipeline using YOLO for object detection and tracking, then build a JSON-based interface to communicate with Cormas in real time. On the Pharo/Cormas side, I will implement the necessary APIs and tools to interpret the visual data and control agent behavior accordingly.\n\nDeliverables include:\n- A reusable computer vision module with manual calibration tools.\n- A JSON-based interface for real-time communication between Python and Pharo.\n- Integration into Cormas as a plugin or extension.\n- Documentation and examples for creating interactive physical games with Cormas.\n- All work will be contributed to the open-source Cormas repository and designed to support future projects involving physical interaction with simulations.",

This approach introduces two key issues:\n1. garbage collection overhead: the GC must scan and track pointers within machine code, increasing complexity and runtime costs.\n2. security risks: direct pointer exposure in executable code creates opportunities for attackers to alter program behavior.\n\nThis project aims to refactor the VM to store object pointers in a separate structure so that the GC can use this structure during memory management. The development plan can be decomposed into three stages:\n1. Analyze the JIT compiler to identify where object pointers are embedded in machine code. A documentation or a technical blog should follow after this step.\n2. Modify the JIT compiler to use a dedicated structure to store object pointers.\n3.

          "description": "This project aims to build ChatPharo, an intelligent, AI-powered assistant that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the Pharo development environment. Despite Pharo’s strengths as a live programming platform, it currently lacks a native and user-friendly interface for interacting with LLMs to assist with code explanation, generation, documentation, and debugging.\n\nTo address this, the project proposes a seamless, modular, and extensible system that connects Pharo with both online (OpenAI, DeepSeek) and offline (TinyLLaMA, Mistral-7B via Ollama) models. A multi-tab chat interface will allow users to manage multiple contextual conversations, while intelligent AI commands (e.g., /explain, /generate tests, /refactor) will directly support day-to-day coding workflows. Memory optimization techniques—including smart caching, chat pruning, and lazy model loading—will ensure smooth performance even in long sessions.\n\nA key innovation includes experimenting with pseudo-parallelism in Pharo’s single-threaded architecture by spawning secondary images to offload heavy LLM processing. This enables parallel task handling without compromising the responsiveness of the main Pharo image.\n\nBy midterm, users will have access to a working chat UI, multi-LLM switching, and foundational coding actions. By the final evaluation, ChatPharo will evolve into a context-aware assistant capable of inline suggestions, AI-driven debugging, and scalable architecture for future extensions.\n\nThrough full documentation, tutorials, and community engagement, this project will not only enhance developer productivity but also showcase Pharo as a capable, modern AI-enhanced development platform.",

Dialogflow or Rasa NLP tools serve as optional enhancements for the bot allowing better processing of natural language verbalisations. Core features include:\n\n1. The system provides automatic appointment booking alongside immediate patient record availability.\n2. The system provides timely notification systems for upcoming meetings along with post-appointment check-up scheduling.\n3. The system provides immediate FAQs as part of its user satisfaction enhancement measures.\n4. Real-time communication on WhatsApp provides users with a smooth experience alongside extensive system reachability.\n\nThe solution enhances the CARE platform through workforce efficiency while it decreases human errors in addition to enabling accessible reliable and responsive communication.

          "description": "This project enhances the OpenAFS Linux kernel module with multi-page folio support, addressing a key performance limitation in the current implementation. OpenAFS currently interacts with the Linux kernel's memory management system through single-page operations, despite recent kernel versions offering folio APIs capable of managing multiple contiguous pages as a single unit.\n\nI will implement comprehensive multi-page folio support in OpenAFS by modifying key components of the cache manager, particularly focusing on the VFS interface layer where the largest performance benefits can be realized. The implementation will optimize read and write paths to efficiently handle larger memory regions while maintaining backward compatibility with older kernel versions through autoconf detection and conditional compilation.\n\nBy the end of the project, I will deliver: (1) A complete implementation of multi-page folio support that improves performance, especially for sequential read operations common in application deployment; (2) A comprehensive testing framework verifying functionality across multiple kernel versions; (3) Detailed performance benchmarks demonstrating throughput and resource utilization improvements; and (4) Thorough documentation of implementation details to facilitate future maintenance. All code will be submitted as incremental, well-structured patches adhering to OpenAFS coding standards.",

          "description": "This project aims to develop a GNOME Shell extension that provides a user-friendly graphical interface for managing the OpenAFS client on Linux desktops. OpenAFS, a distributed file system widely used in academic and research environments, currently relies on command-line tools, which can be intimidating for users accustomed to graphical interfaces. The extension will integrate into the GNOME Shell top bar, offering a dropdown menu to start/stop the OpenAFS client, acquire and manage authentication tokens, and display key status information such as token expiration and cell connectivity. Deliverables include a fully functional extension with client control, token management, status indicators, and notifications, all developed using GJS and GNOME Shell APIs. The project will be completed over 12 weeks, with iterative development and testing to ensure a polished, user-friendly tool.",

          "description": "Institutional departments, such as the Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Department of Emory University School of Medicine, manage vast amounts of data, often reaching petabyte scales across multiple Linux-based storage servers. Researchers storing data in these systems need a streamlined way to modify ACLs to grant or revoke access for collaborators. Currently, the IT team at BMI is responsible for manually handling these ACL modifications, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially as data volume and user demands grow.\n\nTo address this challenge at BMI and similar institutions worldwide, a Web Management Interface is needed to allow users to modify ACLs securely. This solution would eliminate the burden on IT teams by enabling on-demand permission management while ensuring security and reliability.\n\nThe proposed system will feature a robust and highly configurable backend, high-speed databases, orchestration daemons for file storage servers, and an intuitive frontend. The proposal includes an in-depth analysis of required components, high-level and low-level design considerations, technology selection, and the demonstration of a functional prototype as proof of concept.\n\nThe goal is to deliver a production-ready, secure, scalable, and reliable system for managing ACLs across multiple servers hosting filesystems such as NFS, BeeGFS, and others. This solution will streamline access control management and prepare it for deployment at BMI and other institutions worldwide, significantly reducing the manual workload for IT teams.",

          "description": "Acquiring neural fMRI and abdominal MRI data is inherently expensive and time-consuming, significantly limiting the volume of datasets available for advanced analysis. Consequently, the full potential of GI tract disease diagnosis and segmentation models remains unrealized, as limited datasets hinder their accuracy and generalizability.\n\nDiffusion models offer a promising solution to these challenges. By effectively learning intricate spatiotemporal patterns inherent in fMRI/MRI data, diffusion models can synthesize high-quality, realistic data samples. This capability augments available datasets, substantially enhancing the accuracy and reliability of GI tract semantic segmentation and disease diagnosis models.",
