          "description": "My proposal is to extend the Python package dingo with two Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods, which will enable exponential sampling from the set of flux vectors for constraint-based metabolic modelling. The sampling methods - NUTS Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Reflective Exact HMC, and Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - have already been implemented in C++ and integrated into the volesti codebase. The extended C++ bindings and Python wrappers will enable access to these methods through dingo.\n\nThis will involve running experiments on benchmark metabolic networks to compare the results obtained from the new random walks and the existing Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling method based on Billiard walk. The experiments will generate new biological insights by providing an exponential sampling of flux vectors, which will allow for an unbiased characterization of the metabolic capabilities of biochemical networks. The final deliverables of the project will be the extended dingo package, the results of the experiments, and a brief report discussing the findings.",

This is important as user need to brows through the all the existing models which are the part of the repository and download only selective models. A structured local storage will not only also allow users to easily add their own models to the local library management system, but also to the online repository open to public.

          "description": "On-machine Inspection (OMI) is a valuable tool used in CNC commercial manufacturing to ensure proper tolerances of the manufactured piece. This is done by attaching a probe to the tool head of the machine and scanning the surface of the finalised product to see if there are discrepancies between the expected result and actual measurements. \n\nIncluding such a tool on FreeCAD, which already has a dedicated set of tools for CNC milling in the Path Workbench, will not only bring it closer to proprietary solutions but even surpass some of them that don't have this feature. This would save time for the machinist and also increase the inherent accuracy of the whole process.\n\nBuilding upon this, sensing solutions can introduce novel approaches to improve the CAM workflow and even generate new solutions not seen before. This proposal argues for an automatized post-processing of, for example, 3D prints by milling them to correct tolerances and inherent defects of the manufacturing process like layer patterns, over-extrusion or limited resolution. \n\nFor On-machine inspection, there are already commercial solutions available so it's a matter of replicating their implementations on Python for FreeCAD. For the post-processing tool, a more involved overview of optimization algorithms for closely-matching volumes will be needed but it's surely available in the literature. If not, my background in mathematics and physics should prove valuable in the development of such an algorithm.\n\nThus, the main goals for the proposal are to prodive the FreeCAD Path Workbench with two new tools, On-machine Inspection and automatized post-processing of already manufactured pieces, and also to properly test and document these new tools in the FreeCAD wiki.",

In this way, we will know if a change in a dependency has correctly integrated into the broader code base.

They would add support to load Acrostics from disk. Testing support will also be added.\nOnce the files are loading, they would add support to the game itself through widget work. They'd have to write two custom widgets. First, they would write an answer widget that contains a sub-grid and links styles with the main grid. Then they'd modify the clue row widget for acrostics to support the different types of clues.\nAs a final step, a separate widget will be written to add a custom layout for acrostics. Given those acrostics behave differently than crosswords, we want to lay them out differently. This can be done either by extending the existing custom widget, or them writing their own.",

The go-to approach would be a D-Bus daemon that automatically (either on changes or periodically) creates a list of installed Flatpaks and pushes it to a service like GitHub Gists. If a new version is detected (which comes from a different system), the daemon would fetch it and adjust the local installation accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there should be a GUI application that can interface with the daemon for setup and configuration.

          "description": "Automated software engineering helps developers of control software to manage complex industrial applications. Eclipse 4diac has, in recent years, advanced in terms of providing tool support for domain experts. The control software is typically executed in real-time and distributed across devices. Designing such systems is complex due to the need for communication between devices. To detect faults early, modeling implicit assumptions within IEC 61499 software can provide the basis for automated checks. Such assumptions are typically described in constraint languages, which are difficult to use by automation experts. Therefore, this project provides the infrastructure for tool-assisted communication engineering. Where user interactions are required, graphical visualizations are provided. Current infrastructure for generating automated communication does not support the variety of communication protocols that is observed in modern automation systems.",

From a user perspective, these issues unnecessarily complicate trivial tasks like OpenShift console login or finding what a user needs in JKube docs. In many cases, our logs do not give enough information and hints like ‘what went wrong’, making it hard for the users to find fixes. As a mature plugin catered towards developers, we must work on more helpful logging, showing hints and giving the users an overall  better experience. The JKube website needs work, and we need to improve quickstart guides to help new developers getting started with our plugin. These measures will definitely improve JKube’s adoption, and thus are of utmost importance.",

Cppyy is an automatic, run-time, Python-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from Python and Python from C++.\nCppyy has to pay a time penalty each time it needs to switch between languages which can multiply into large slowdowns when using loops with cppyy objects. This is where Numba can help. Since Numba compiles the code in loops into machine code it only has to cross the language barrier once and the loops thus run faster.\nInitial support for Cppyy objects in Numba enabled the use of builtin types and classes, but some essential C++ features, such as references and STL classes, are not yet supported.\n\n\nThe project aims to add support for C++ reference types in Numba through Cppyy and improve the existing numba extension implementation to provide general support for C++ templates. This added support will allow cppyy users to define a wider array of standard and templated functions that can leverage reference types to the C++ code defined in python.",

          "description": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in solving the complex problem of charged particle tracking, which is an essential task in high-energy physics. Charged particle tracking entails reconstructing the trajectory of charged particles produced after particle collisions, and the scalability of GNNs could enable this task to be performed with high efficiency. The first step in applying GNNs to particle detector data is to construct edges between hits, which then enables a GNN to operate on the graph and generate predicted trajectories. The current process for graph construction involves constructing all possible edges first and then removing edges that violate manually set geometric constraints. This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of this graph construction step by creating a point cloud network (PCN) with PyTorch Geometric to perform this task. PCNs are a recently developed class of neural networks that operate directly on point cloud data, and they could be used to perform graph construction without manually selected geometric constraints and with fewer edge constructions in total. This project also involves optimizing hyperparameters for the PCN model architecture and the training process by using Ray tune and Optuna.",

Additionally, I aim to explore the impact of different computing architectures and job submission systems on energy efficiency. To achieve these goals, I will use metrics from the Green Software Foundation and other resources to estimate energy efficiency. I will then evaluate whether to make small changes to the code to improve efficiency and evaluate the potential savings. I will also test the software on different platforms and job submission systems. My expected results include a summary of metrics for software energy consumption, visualisation of test results, and identification of possible improvements to software algorithms.

Due to a current Spark limitation, it is not possible for multiple notebooks to share the same set of Spark resources. In addition, the process of spawning the Spark resources could take a while, and may add an inconvenience.\n\nCurrently, an effort is underway to employ a client-server architecture known as Spark Connect. This would allow multiple notebooks to connect to a previously instantiated Spark session and submit computations to it.\n\nTo make allocating Spark resources easier for users, this project proposes the development of a JupyterLab extension. The extension shall have a friendly interface that would allow users to instantiate one or more Spark sessions–in which the notebook will be able to connect, configure proper credentials and authentication, and make the connection accessible to the notebook code.

          "description": "Markdown provides a great ability to format messages and write structured documents using plain text format.\n\nZulip uses two different markdown processors: for the backend, it is Python-Markdown and for the frontend, it is marked.js.\n\nWhile the backend markdown processor is highly extensible but the current frontend markdown processor doesn’t allow the same. Moreover, it is not upgradeable because of the Zulip customisations.\n\nThe goals of this project are:\n\nRefactor the frontend-markdown processor with CommonMark parser.\nMake the same extensible for Zulip’s custom features like @-mentions.\nI’ll take the reference from commonmark.js to write the CommonMark parser for our frontend-markdown processor. And to make it extensible, I'll use the upstream marked.js.\n\nIn parallel to this, I’ll focus on works in the markdown area. Integrating them with the Zulip will help to increase the overall users’ experience. The list of them are:\n\nAdd support for link shortener\nRe-enable backslash escape inline pattern\nAdd support for online mentions\nAdd support for importing avatar from GitHub on account creation",

          "description": "The Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) is open-source, computational neural\nmodeling software that allows us to examine the cellular- and circuit-level basis of brain responses. HNN requires the hand-tuning of a large set of parameters until a close fit between simulated and recorded data is attained. This hand-tuning can take a\nsubstantial amount of effort thus it is in the user’s best interest to automate the process so that parameters can be optimized in a time efficient manner. The goal of this project is to develop optimization functions that will perform a wide search over the parameter space to arrive at faithful simulations. HNN is currently being used to develop or test hypotheses about underlying circuitry that gives rise to cognitive processes of interest. Developing a robust algorithm for parameter optimization has the potential to illuminate avenues for the diagnosis and treatment of multiple brain disorders and diseases, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric disorders. Finally, contribution to HNN’s codebase will aid researchers who use the tool in yielding important constraints to the development of theories about the origins of human brain responses.",

          "description": "Biologically detailed models are essential tools in neuroscience, and automated methods are frequently used to build and validate such models based on experimental data. The open-source parameter optimization software Neuroptimus was developed to enable easy application of  advanced parameter optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence, to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms, including PCs and supercomputers. While Neuroptimus uses various built-in cost functions and the eFEL feature extraction library to compare model behavior to experimental data, it severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by optimization. However, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows for the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors. Therefore, the goal of this project is to extend Neuroptimus to use HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit, to evaluate model performance during optimization. This project aims to develop a seamless integration between HippoUnit and Neuroptimus, enabling the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons. The new Neuroptimus-HippoUnit integration will allow the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors, which can ultimately lead to improved biophysical models of hippocampal neurons.\nDeliverables: \n1- Implementation of an interface between HippoUnit and the new version of Neuroptimus to enable the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors.\n2- Extend the current supported tests to include all HippoUnit tests.\n3- Integrate the HippoUnit with the Neuroptimus’s GUI so that users can run optimizations directly from the interface.",

          "description": "ASSR refers to the cortical entrainment to frequency and phase of an auditory signal that is presented in a fixed “train of clicks”, in a gamma range rhythm (40 Hz). A hallmark of schizophrenia is a reduction in ASSR; this project aims at reproducing this phenomenon using an auditory cortex (A1) model with thalamocortical connectivity. The latter simulates a cortical column with a depth of 2000 μm and 200 μm diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Specifically, we aim at reproducing results from an experiment looking at the effects of increased CB1 receptor availability and GABA receptor deficits, as these have been linked to the EEG abnormalities that characterize schizophrenia. We will start by running batch simulation tasks to pull out connectivity rules from the A1 model, modifying GABA and CB1 Receptors. This step will be run on a scaled version of the A1, so that I will be able to use a personal computer, but I may employ cloud resources as well.Then, we will analyze parameter sweeps for local field potentials, using the LFPy toolbox. Afterwards, we will move to parameter optimization of the A1 model so that it reproduces the ASSR, using the Optuna HPO toolkit. Our ultimate goal is to reproduce the ASSR phenomenon in the A1 model. For every step of the process, documentation will be made available on a deployed site.",

          "description": "The primary objective of this project is to enhance the code quality, strengthen the test framework, and bolster the reliability of Chromium's Performance API implementation. The Performance API, which encapsulates the Performance interface of the High Resolution Time standard, plays a pivotal role in enabling web developers to accurately identify and troubleshoot bottlenecks within their web applications. To ensure uniformity in functionality and compliance with current standards across diverse web browsers, the web-platform-test features a comprehensive suite of tests. Over the course of this project, in close collaboration with experienced mentors, the focus will be on harmonizing Chromium's Performance API implementation with the web standards. This endeavour involves meticulous analysis, debugging, and the resolution of issues and failures reported by the web-platform-tests. This comprehensive undertaking will culminate in a secure and more reliable browser ensuring enhanced user experience. These optimizations shall align with Chromium's core principles of speed, security, stability, and simplicity.",

WebAssembly is especially popular for web games and other performance-oriented applications. As of March 2023, Emscripten uses an emulated file system written in JavaScript to support C/C++ file system operations in compiled WebAssembly code. Currently, the mentors are working on WasmFS, an emulated file system built in C++/WebAssembly, for Emscripten. However, WasmFS lacks the JavaScript required to connect the existing JS API to the new C++/WebAssembly file system operations. \r\n\r\nThe central goal of this project is to build a new JavaScript library modeled after Emscripten’s existing file system library that will call WasmFS functions instead of JavaScript routines. This approach aims to speed up filesystem operations and lay the foundation to add multithreading in the future. That being said, this project does not aim to redesign the filesystem implementation for Emscripten. This project also will not add new functionality to the Emscripten file system. Finally, this project will not attempt to add full multithreading functionality yet.",

          "description": "There is currently no robust and unified sparse ndarray library that is compliant with the numpy API. This prevents the substitution of sparse arrays for dense arrays when needed in many data science workflows. PyData/Sparse is a repository that presents an opportunity to address these issues. In order to do so, there needs to be a C++ implementation of a code-generation algorithm that can generate efficient code for any type of sparse tensor operation. This abstraction allows one to maintain a relatively small piece of code that enables functionality for an exponential number of different sparse array format operations. The main objective of the project is to implement, test and document the merge lattice and its related data structures and algorithms that are vital for code-generation. This will result in a generalizable code-generation algorithm that can be applied for implementing a variety of different sparse ndarray formats that work together. This will involve interfacing heavily with the existing C++ code and its implemented templates to add functionality that constructs and manipulates a merge lattice, which is a useful abstraction in code-generation for sparse tensor algebra operations. As a few stretch goals, I plan on: i) implementing abstractions of what a sparse array is and what operations can be done that leverage this underlying core API, ii) finishing the co-iteration algorithm to account for non-unique and non-ordered levels and iii) begin work on the actual code-generation algorithm that leverages the merge lattice.",

The runtime operation could use the SymEngine library for LLVM, C and C++ backends. For Python backend, we can simply use SymPy itself.\n\nThe algorithms would be implemented in the ASR code, which would make them independent of any specific frontend. Any frontend that uses the ASR code could then make use of the symbolic algorithms without having to reimplement them. LPython, in this case, would not implement the symbolic algorithms themselves, but would instead parse the syntax used by the SymPy library, which already has a rich set of symbolic algorithms, and use the ASR representation of these expressions to perform various operations. This would allow LPython to have powerful symbolic manipulation capabilities without having to reinvent the wheel.",

          "description": "My proposed project aims to enhance the Borg ecosystem by tackling three main areas: Filter option in diff and extract view in Vorta, implement live binary tests in Vorta, and bootstrap a Borgmatic restore from nothing. These improvements will help users more efficiently and effectively manage their backups, improve testing processes, and facilitate disaster recovery.\n\nFirstly, I will implement a search function that allows users to filter files by search string in Vorta's diff and extract view. I will also add the \"Change\" filter to the comparison view, which will filter only removed, added, and modified files. This task also includes adding syntax to allow advanced filtering and filter by size range as a stretch goal. These enhancements will help users easily find and manage their backup files.\n\nSecondly, I will improve BorgBackup testing by implementing live binary tests in Vorta. Currently Vorta contains stdout and stderr mock files for the Borg JSON output of various commands for testing purposes but there’s no actual running of the commands. Moreover, it only supports one mock file while Vorta supports multiple Borg versions where output syntax may vary.\n\nThis project aims to improve Vorta Testing by implementing live binary tests that run on multiple actual Borg versions/binaries. I'll also integrate live binary tests with Vorta's CI/CD pipeline. \n\nFinally, I will implement bootstrap functionality in Borgmatic to restore backups from nothing, enabling users to easily recover their data in the event of a disaster. I will implement this feature by providing clear and comprehensive documentation, which will outline the steps required to perform a Borgmatic restore from scratch. This will significantly improve disaster recovery capabilities and reduce the risk of data loss.",

          "description": "Modernize fs_filepicker:\nThe fs_filepicker is a GUI used for selecting files in the msui_settings.json configuration file. Currently, the GUI only offers a basic set of navigation elements for selecting a file and returns the fs URL for accessing it. The goal of this project is to modernize the GUI using the Pyfilesystem module to make it more user-friendly and efficient.\nPyfilesystem is a Python module used for accessing different types of file systems. It provides a common API for working with various file systems, such as local, remote, and cloud-based storage systems. The Pyfilesystem module is easy to use and has many features that can be used to improve the functionality of the fs_filepicker.\n\nView Layout and Restoring::\nThe mscolab project is a collaborative software platform that enables multiple users to work together on a shared project in real-time. The project is written in Python and uses the PyQT GUI library for the user interface. Currently, the PyQT Gui of the MSS client can handle different views by one flight path. However, once a new flight path is loaded and activated, all views change to this flight path. This is inconvenient for users who want to work on multiple flight paths simultaneously. Additionally, the view configuration consists of many windows with a complex set of configuration options that are tedious to re-create after shutting down the application.\nThis proposal aims to improve the mscolab user interface by adding the ability to store and restore the view configuration of multiple windows for the user. Additionally, the proposal seeks to add a layout option for any participant on the same flight path, as well as the ability for the creator of an operation to set the layout of all participants.",

The following is a brief outline of each project problem, solution, and set of deliverables:\n\nProject 1) Improving Test Coverage\n\nProblem: Vorta has a current test code coverage of 72%, and we would like to get this in the 80% - 85% range. Additionally, current testing files need more a consistent file structure and organization.\n\nSolution: Work with organization mentors to prioritize test code coverage. Create unit and integration tests to reach our target code coverage. Reorganize and restructure testing file.\n\nDeliverables: At least 80% code coverage, with a stretch goal of 85%. Test files separated into unit tests vs integration tests. Consistency in file naming and structure across all test files.\n\nProject 2) Implement Profile Sidebar\n\nProblem: The current profile selector and setting tab implementation mixes global setting with profile specific settings. \n\nSolution: Move the profile selector and settings button to a collapsible sidebar. The settings button opens a new interface with options relating to global settings and profile management, while the individual profile buttons open to profile specific settings.\n\nDeliverables: A new sidebar with profile selector and setting button, as well as a new setting interface. Unit and integration testing accompanying all new features.\n\nProject 3: Test on Live Borg Binary\n\nProblem: Currently we test on static mock files of Borg JSON output. This task would improve testing to run on actual Borg versions/binaries.\n\nSolution: Test multiple versions of Borg using Tox to simplify testing. Implement these changes in setup.cfg\n\nDeliverables: CICD running tests on live Borg binaries with > 99% success rate. Include the option to run existing integration tests locally. Include thorough documentation of this process.",

The objective is to create a new development environment for security rules in a web single-page application, allowing Falco to run directly inside the browser. The goal is to provide a more versatile and user-friendly tool for developing and testing security rules. The plan is to leverage the Emscripten toolchain to accomplish this. The result will be a web-based application similar to the Go Playground, but without requiring any backend. The deliverables will include a fully functional development environment, a detailed guide for using the application, and documentation for the project.",

The solution this proposal provides is that in order to create a plugin for kubectl we need the help of armadactl i.e. command-line utility for Armada through which users submit their jobs to the Armada server. To develop a plugin for kubectl, we first must develop a base plugin for armadactl in Go that performs basic tasks such as submission and cancellation of jobs, creation of queues, etc. After the necessary coding for the plugin is finished, we now distribute that plugin over at Krew so that it is globally accessible. Once it is distributed at Krew, a user can install this plugin as a kubectl plugin and can interact with the Armada server and perform the aforementioned tasks.",

          "description": "clusterProfiler is an efficient package that provides a universal interface for gene functional annotation from a variety of resources and is extremely helpful in data manipulation and its visualization. The idea of integrating Pathway Commons, which is an aggregated database of molecular interactions of approximately 20 databases, brings in scope to analyze data and obtain better results. However, the data lies in GMT format due to which it requires additional functions to bind pathways with their name and gene. It is then saved in RDS format to feed the enricher() function to obtain an enrichResult object. We perform ORA and GSEA using some functions defined in R script on Pathway Commons data to support it in clusterProfiler.\n\nWith the advent of a new technique ssGSEA (single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) used to quantify the activity of a specific pathway or gene set in individual sample,for example, analyzing heterogeneous samples (tumor samples), integration of ssGSEA with clusterProfiler will help in better medical analyses. Thus, using packages like GSVA(Gene set variation analysis) and GenePattern we can calculate enrichment scores in permutations and support ssGSEA  in clusterProfiler.",

          "description": "Virtiofs is a shared file system that lets virtual machines access a directory tree on the host. Unlike existing approaches, it is designed to offer local file system semantics and performance. \n\nCurrently, virtiofsd integrates the sandboxing code and the server code in a single binary. The goal is to extract that code and create an external tool that creates a sandbox environment and runs virtiofsd in it. This will make it easier to develop sandboxing features and virtiofsd side by side.\n\nIn addition, that tool should be extended to be able to run virtiofsd in a restricted environment with Landlock. Landlock is a Linux kernel module that allows unprivileged processes to restrict their own access rights. This will enable the tool to apply access restrictions to virtiofsd without requiring privileged access, in a way that is enforced by the kernel, thereby increasing the protection of virtiofsd users.\n\nThis will allow greater flexibility when integrating virtiofsd into a VMM or running it inside a container, due to how Landlock enforces access restriction rules as composable security layers that are compatible with system access controls.",

          "description": "When tackling the challenge of detecting defects in high-resolution images, we encounter many challenges. One significant problem is the difficulty in training models effectively, primarily due to memory limitations. The process of down-sampling these images to fit within memory capacities leads to the loss of crucial information, which can result in the oversight of small yet significant defects.\n\nTo overcome these issues, we can employ a strategy involving a tiled ensemble mechanism. In this case, images are split into smaller, manageable tiles. Each of these tiles is then processed using a separate model, specifically trained for that tile position. This strategy enhances localization and improves the detection of small anomalies, while also satisfying memory limitations.\n\nAnomalib currently has a basic tiler. However, the advantages of locally-aware models, like Padim, are diminished without the support of a tiled ensemble. To address this problem, we introduce a tiled ensemble implementation that preserves the advantages of local awareness while also enhancing overall performance. \n\nThis approach aims to incorporate Anomalib's existing features, while simultaneously providing users the flexibility to tailor specific steps within our pipeline. All the while, we ensure that our approach remains memory-efficient.",

Such a library would benefit from solutions like OpenVINO that offer extensive integrations in the ML ecosystem and even further optimization capabilities for inferring and deploying models on a range of hardware platforms.

          "description": "TARDIS operates on a “photospheric” inner boundary approximation. A hard inner boundary in velocity is set from which radiative packets are emitted through the ejecta according to a black-body distribution at a given temperature. Currently, TARDIS can solve for the radiative and inner boundary temperatures as well as dilution factors given a static inner velocity boundary. The precise location of where this inner boundary velocity should be placed is not always obvious and there are a few methods by which one can intelligently select a location based on the properties of the plasma (which are constantly updating over each iteration).\n\nThis project will aim to update the location of the inner boundary velocity based on a set of options for desired properties of the plasma at each iteration. The options include setting the inner boundary velocity according to a given optical depth over all frequencies (either Planck or Rossland mean opacities) or setting the inner boundary according to a desired value for the dilution factors.\n\nThe project can be broken down into the following four deliverables:\n\n- Estimating the inner velocity value based on target values of optical depth and dilution factor\n\n- Integrate the estimation methods into TARDIS base\n\n- Write thorough test cases for all the above changes.\n\n- Make Jupyter notebooks and tutorials demonstrating the feature.\n\n-Thorough documentation of the changes.\n\n- Write a blog about the project.",

          "description": "TARDIS generates synthetic observations of stellar explosions that can be compared to real observations. With such comparisons, we can learn more about the physical processes occurring and the conditions inside the supernova, including which elements and atomic transitions are dominant. TARDIS tracks the atomic transitions of interacting photons, level populations, etc. allowing the user to interrogate the physical conditions of the supernova. The goal of this project is to build a visual tool to represent this information for the user in Grotrian diagrams, which show different atomic levels of ions and transitions between them. Developing this tool will allow the user to more easily understand the important physical conditions of their supernova model.\n\nA regular Grotrian diagram would only display the overall line interaction for the packets that interact with the ion, but we also want to display how many packets went through each specific transition and the level populations. One way it could be done is to color each arrow to represent quantity of packets (similar to a heatmap) and the thickness of the level platforms denoting the level populations. This project will have the following deliverables:\n\n- Develop an interactive widget which allows the user to look at the Grotrian diagram for specific ions which interacted with photon packets during a TARDIS simulation.\n\n- The widget should allow the user to filter on a wavelength range, type of line interaction (excitation or de-excitation), and ion. The diagram will also give a sense of the frequency of each line transition using colors.\n\n- Develop the above plot as a static Matplotlib too.\n\n- Integrate this widget into TARDIS codebase and documentation.\n\n- Create a Jupyter notebook tutorial for the tool.",

Also, the code responsible for sending POST codes is spread out throughout the codebase in both C and Assembly languages. Some parts of the code use functions, some use macros, and others simply use the ‘outb()’ instruction. Additionally, the POST codes are duplicated across different stages and aren't properly documented, which makes it difficult to understand and maintain the code. \nTo improve the code, the Kconfigs should be guarded with a \"depends on\" statement to only show on supported platforms, duplicated Kconfigs should be removed, ‘outb()’ calls should be replaced with ‘post_code()’ if it is sending out POST code, the documentation should be updated, macros from the post_code.h file should be used wherever possible, duplicated POST codes should be dropped, and all possible 255 values should be utilized. Finally, new POST codes should be added in a standardized manner to maintain the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.",

          "description": "The world of JSON Schema is immense. JSON Schema tooling exists in countless languages across a variety of uses (data validation of course a noteworthy and prominent one). Implementing the JSON Schema specification(s) in a fully compliant way is not without challenge, meaning as a user of JSON Schema it is important to understand how a particular implementation may deviate such that one can make constructive tooling choices or help implementations improve. Bowtie is a recently created tool to aide in this task, helping to surface the conformance of various JSON Schema tools with the specification by running them against a set of known correct test cases and regularly rendering the results to a web page. But it can do more!\n\nExpected Outcomes:\nEnhance (or replace) Bowtie's simplistic current UI so that it most easily answers \"what do various implementations say about each test case\" -- making it snappier and more featureful\nAdd support for further JSON Schema implementations by creating Bowtie harnesses in additional languages\nTeach Bowtie to compare not only True/False validation results but also the full JSON Schema standardized output formats",

However, there is currently no way to gather data about CPU and memory usage during execution time, which makes it difficult to make further performance improvements to the project. Therefore, this project seeks to remedy this by creating a set of tools to gather performance data about the IDS execution behavior.\nTo improve performance data gathering capabilities, the following features will be added to the project:\n- CPU profiling module\n- Memory profiling module\n- Both modules will allow for: Export of profile data, output as both absolute and difference from input profile baseline (if provided), output as data stream\n- CPU/Memory data visualization/analysis module which can: Show process resource usage over time, can restrict to top however many if desired, histogram of resource consumption and time spent at consumption level for a single module, and recommendation lists for modules needing optimization, scoring criteria based on highest memory/CPU usage, longest blocking time, and weighted aggregate score.",

The OGC SensorThings API provides an open, geospatial-enabled and unified way to interconnect the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data, and applications over the Web. The project aims to extend interoperability and implement some of the basic APIs from STA that could be adopted in a new revised version of istSOS.\r\nFastAPI can be used for the request and response of the istSOS STA services. As PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse in istSOS project, data can be managed using postGIS which is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database.\r\nPostgREST is a standalone web server that could be used to turn the PostgreSQL database of STA data directly into a RESTful API.\r\nFinally the STA service can be integrated with the istSOS project.",

          "description": "The objective of this proposal is to enhance the user experiences for readers of Open Library through a two-prong approach. \n\nThe first prong, Improving Site Performance, addresses the poor site performance that negatively affects our patrons’ experience. This prong takes a metric-based approach to identify the key bottlenecks of performance using various performance measurement tools. This metric-based approach allows us to identify the areas for performance optimisation and quantify the effects of our changes. \n\nThe second prong, Implementing Subject Tags, seeks to offer a more resourceful alternative to the Subject tags that are currently implemented for books in Open Library. The current Subject tags, which are implemented as a list of strings, are limited in extensibility and scalability, and are not an efficient tool in categorising and providing information about books. Subject Tags will be implemented as first-class objects, allowing for metadata to be included within tags. The metadata will provide relationships and hierarchy between subjects, internationalisation (i18n) information, additional description about tags and many other extensible information fields. Upon the success of this implementation, its utility will catalyse improvement within numerous avenues in the Open Library system which includes the search engine, Subject page interface, content advisory and many more. \n\nThese two prongs work together to improve the overall patron experience, making the site more enjoyable to use and enriching the information about books.",

If the page is broken or doesn't exist, the server responds with a 404 error code or some other error code in the 4xx and 5xx range, indicating an issue, and 200 OK (or some other status codes in the 2xx range) if everything is good. However, a common challenge arises when the server returns a 200 OK in every case, making it difficult for computers to differentiate between a healthy page and a problematic one. If these problematic pages go unnoticed and are not replaced with their healthy counterparts over time, they contribute to a pervasive issue known as \"link rot,\" leading to the gradual loss of valuable internet information.\n\n\n\nThis work addresses such issues by performing content analysis of webpages to identify potential soft-404s that would otherwise go undetected due to the wrong HTTP status code they return. A prior version of such soft-404 pages is then looked up in the Wayback Machine to replace the link in the Wikipedia article with, if present.",

To do this, we will create a set of APIs and ingestion protocols that allow text data to be parsed and tagged while utilising ensemble learning, W2V, and LSA/LDA algorithms to produce tailored suggestions based on user preferences. Additionally, we'll put in place a user-friendly front-end interface that allows API-based queries, extensive unit testing, and optimisation.\n\nA completely working document retrieval and recommendation system, as well as a strong set of APIs and ingestion protocols for processing sizable amounts of text data, will be included in our deliverables.

          "description": "Polygons are defined by one outer ring and possibly multiple inner rings representing holes, where each ring is usually represented as a sequence of points. This allows for several undesirable configurations, such as self-intersecting rings, badly nested rings (inner outside outer), and inner rings that split the interior of the polygon into multiple disjoint parts. Such undesirable configurations are considered as invalid polygons in many applications, such as in Geographic Information Systems through ISO 19107.\n\nThe aim of this project is to incorporate the polygon repair method originally described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.01.009 (but later improved) as a CGAL package. This method consists of three steps: (1) a constrained triangulation of the polygon, (2) labelling of its faces as interior/exterior, (3) extraction of the resulting polygon(s) from the sets of labelled triangular faces.\n\nThe method is already implemented using CGAL and freely available as prepair: https://github.com/tudelft3d/prepair. Integrating it with CGAL as a new package would likely involve switching the code's GDAL dependency with new functions for native CGAL types, adding some functionality in the CGAL 2D/3D Triangulations package (proper deletion of constraints), and the writing of CGAL-style templated code (with support for different kernels and so on).",

          "description": "The goal of the project is to add the \"Virtual Source Propagation\" (Trettner, Bommes, Kobbelt 2021) algorithm to CGAL. This algorithm finds approximate geodesic paths and distance by propagating virtual geodesic sources along the mesh. By the time of the midterm evaluation, we intend to have a working algorithm, some tests and first optimisations. During the second coding phase, we want to further optimise the code and add CPU parallelisation. Afterwards, all the geodesic paths computation methods will be compared in term of accuracy, speed and how they scale with the mesh size and geodesic length so that CGAL users can choose the algorithm that is the best fit for their problem.",

In brief, this is to be accomplished by creating a new directive `SecRateLimitOptions` for specifying the rate limit options(no. of requests allowed per minute, the algorithm used, when to clear rate limit, default action if rate limit exceeds) and a new non-disruptive action `rate limit` which enforces rate-limit on the matching chains of SecRule.

In version 2 To cover the newest printers, it adds new properties. All of the software offered by OpenPrinting is based on IPP Everywhere 1.x, so it must be updated in order to exploit printer functionalities supported by the current version of the standard.\n\nIPP defines the core IPP v2.0 and  IPP driver replacement extension v2.0 defines IPP extension support to certain use cases, this all is done so that we do not need to use traditional driver specific software's. IPP Job Processing Extension v2.0 defines a wide range of properties and values to determine how a Printer should handle jobs and documents. This specification should cover certain use cases given the requirement for managing Jobs, setting Job processing choices, and retrieving processing status data.\nI have to Implement the new attributes and IPP operations in libcupsfilters and CPDB(write necessary code).\nMy job is to update everything to comply with IPP Everywhere 2.0, IPP Driver Replacement Extensions v2.0, and IPP Job Extensions v2.1, as well as to add the new functionality in accordance with the new standards.

Instead of directly connecting to each print technologies separately, the GUI projects only must adopt CPDB support once, and then OpenPrinting takes care of the CPDB Backend for the print technologies to be up to date with any changes . \n\ntask is to get CPDB into the print dialogs upstream, the UI of them does not need to be changed.

The goal is to develop a voice assistant that can understand voice commands and take necessary action based on them (e.g. turn down the volume, increase AC temperature).\n\n-- Implementation Details:\n    The current Vosk Kaldi speech-to-text functionality will be enhanced by integrating the Snips and RASA NLU engine. The NLU engine will help in extracting the context and intent of voice commands. The extracted intent will be used directly or indirectly by a gRPC-based service which will execute it by communicating with the underlying Kuksa Server APIs. \n\n-- Deliverables:\n    1.) Integration and development of Snips and RASA Natural Language Understanding Intent Engines with existing Vosk implementation.\n    2.) Ability to execute the intent extracted from the NLU engine using a gRPC-based server, GStreamer, and Kuksa.\n    3.)

Same for remote CUPS printers and also Printer Applications . They are all discovered as IPP print services.\nAnd listings of IPP print services have different requirements: One server can have more than one individual print service and these should get listed together. This could be a print queue and a fax out queue of the same multi-function printer, or two physical legacy printers supported by one Printer Application. Also the user interaction coupled to each listing is different. We do not need to configure PPD option settings, but instead, we need access to the IPP service's web administration interface and also to an IPP System Service configuration panel by a simple mouse click.\nSeveral parts of this were already coded in previous GSoCs, but we need to get everything smoothly integrated in the “Printers” part of the GNOME Control Center.

          "description": "To protect a free software project worked on by several contributors against regressions caused by a committed change, one needs frequent, automated testing of the code base, ideally triggered by every commit into the repository. This is called Continuous Integration (CI).\nWhat is triggered on each commit is usually some static analysis of the code using common, specialized tools and build and execution tests, usually doing `./configure; make; make test` on different system platforms.\nThis naturally requires test scripts/programs compiled and run by the `make test` step. For CUPS, for example, the daemon is started (on an unprivileged port so that it does not need root), queues created and listed, jobs sent, and the logs checked whether everything went OK. For Ghostscript, a large collection of input files (gathered from bug reports) is processed and converted into raster formats.\nThe task here is to write test programs for the different OpenPrinting projects so that `make test` does something useful, efficiently catching regressions. They should exercise important functionality of the software with different parameters and analyze logs and output files to check whether the program did the expected work.\nTest programs are also needed for the so-called 'autopkgtest' tests which are added to Debian packages and executed whenever the package is uploaded to Debian or Ubuntu.\nIn addition, instruction files and shell scripts are needed to build the software on different platforms/environments, run tests, and create GitHub Actions (for the automatic triggering on each commit)",

Since the UI has been deprecated, we need to make sure that the CLI is fully functional and easy to scale and modify in the upcoming years.

Keploy works, but the code is all over the place, unit test logic is embedded with actual code, there are lots of internal context on functions that should be better documented, etc.\n\nThe last goal is to make it easy for the maintainers of the project to accept contributions from outsiders. Currently, one of the maintainers needs to manually test the changes locally to ensure that no regression has been caused. We need to automate this process, requiring stricter unit tests (which would only be feasible for newcomers if we have the framework in place).",

          "description": "GIMP utilizes a Destructive Editing workflow – all changes are made directly to the image itself. A much requested feature is Non-Destructive Editing (NDE) which would allow users to make changes without overwriting the original image. This would mean they can easily revert prior edits, modify the settings of filters to see live changes, and rearrange the order that effects are applied in. \n\nGIMP’s image processing engine GEGL is fully capable of many NDE operations. However, these features are not fully exposed to users. The goal of this project would be to enable Non-Destructive Editing on individual layers and layer groups through “Layer Effects” such as drop shadows and brightness/contrast filters. A basic implementation consists of three milestones:\n\n1. Research and design a NDE workflow that compliments GIMP’s current design and user base.\n\n2. Implement “Layer Effects” for GIMP’s regular and text layers as well as layer groups.\n\n3. Add support to the PSD plug-in to recognize and import equivalent “Layer Styles” and “Adjustment Layers” as NDE Layer Effects.",

One such SoC is TDA4VM, with heterogeneous multicore support it can run multiple operating systems simultaneously. TDA4VM has Dual 64-bit Arm® Cortex®-A72 microprocessor subsystem at up to 2.0 GHz, Six Arm® Cortex®-R5F MCUs at up to 1.0 GHz, Two C66x floating point DSP, up to 1.35 GHz, 40 GFLOPS, 160 GOPS and 3D GPU PowerVR® Rogue 8XE GE8430, up to 750 MHz, 96 GFLOPS, 6 Gpix/sec.\nZephyr is a small real-time operating system for connected, resource-constrained and embedded devices supporting multiple architectures. Zephyr allows for easy handling of multiple configuration options, APIs and external components, and is well suited to structured application development. Another benefit of Zephyr is that it targets some very serious protocol and standard implementations, being e.g. the first open source RTOS to introduce TSN support – by way of Antmicro’s contribution. The rising popularity of TSN in automotive and aerospace applications, and just about everywhere else, could be a very important reason to start using Zephyr in your TSN-capable product.\nThe goal of the project is to add Zephyr RTOS support to run on Cortex R5 processor core loaded from A72 core running Linux through remoteproc and add few peripheral support (Interrupts, Gpio, UART, Timers) for TDA4VM. The Cortex R5 processor cores are built to provide deeply embedded real-time and safety-critical systems.

A lot of unit tests are run in Jenkins when contributers submit their patches to gerrit. It usually takes hours to run all the tests across different platforms, especially in rush hours. Therefore, a better test selection method is needed to reduce the load in testing while maintaining a high software quality.\n\nRecently, machine learning is used to predict whether a patch can pass a given test. This can greatly reduce the testing load because we can skip the tests that is very likely to pass when a patch is submitted. Although feature engineering isn't trivial, transformers have been proved useful in feature extraction under similar problem settings. Therefore, I propose that we can implement a machine learning based test selection method to select tests to run in the CI chain to reduce testing load.",

          "description": "Scalable systems lay essential foundations of the modern information industry. HPC data centers tend to have hundreds to thousands of nodes in their clusters. The use of “extreme-scale” distributed systems has given birth to a new type of bug: scalability bugs. As its name suggests, scalability bugs may be presented depending on the scale of a run, and thus, symptoms may only be observable in large-scale deployments, but not in small or median deployments. For example, Cassandra-6127 is a scalability bug detected in the popular distributed database Cassandra. The scalability bug causes unnecessary CPU usage, however, the symptom is not observed unless ~1000 nodes are deployed. This demonstrates the main challenge of studying scalability bugs: it is extremely challenging to reproduce without deploying the system at a large scale.\n\nThe project goal is to build a dataset of reproducible scalability bugs. Achieving this will involve analyzing bug reports from popular distributed systems like (e.g., Cassandra, HDFS, Ignite, Kafka) and determining if the reported bug depends on the scale of the run, such as the number of nodes utilized, the size of files, and the number of requests. Identified bugs will be used to build a dataset of bug artifacts that contain the buggy and fixed versions of the scalability system, a runtime environment that ensures reproducibility, and a workload shell script that would trigger some system functionalities and demonstrate the symptoms of the bug under different configurations. For example, a successful reproduction should be able to show the performance drop along with an increasing number of nodes.",

          "description": "Faust is a functional programming language that enables people to express sound synthesis and audio processing algorithms concisely, efficiently, and portably. It is known for targeting a wide variety of environments: Faust code compiles to C, C++, LLVM IR and more, and for many different audio APIs and environments. In recent years, following the development of asm.js, Emscripten, Audio Worklets, and WebAssembly, the web has become an increasingly viable platform for DSP and audio programming. Prior work has enabled the generation of Audio Worklets (and older Script Processor Nodes) from Faust code. Furthermore, Faust has web-based tools such as an editor, IDE, and playground that allow people to easily try the language and hear the results without installing a compiler toolchain. I propose to improve Faust's support for the web platform by 1) updating and extending the Faust web tools and 2) building on Faust's ability to target WebAssembly in order to make Faust documentation more usable and to make it easier to find and share Faust code on the web.",

Now that the basics are there, with some guidance, it is relatively simple to add new functionality.\n\nSummary from my proposal:\nAround a year ago, Flamenco—a rendering-farm Blender addon—was released to improve the workflow for animation artists across the globe. It is extremely successful, but still has many key functionalities that can greatly improve it. The goal of this project is to build upon the foundation of Flamenco, such as designing a web interface for the manager configuration, introducing RNA overrides, and improving stability, to bring it to its full potential.",

Expressing different concepts such as time, place, and emotion comes with speech and some movements called body gestures. The aim of this project is to detect these commonly occurring phrase and gesture combinations to get meaningful patterns and insights. For this, I propose a multi-modal multi-phase pipeline that captures different patterns of body gestures and speech phrases aligned with an articulated time. The three-stage pipeline begins with pose feature extraction in which both supervised\nand unsupervised approaches shall be incorporated to classify and cluster various gesture classes. In the next stage phrase features are extracted. These extracted features are then passed through the next stage. This stage will produce a synchronized dataset by aligning extracted features in time by applying late fusion. Lastly, Apriori Algorithm is applied to identify the frequent phrase and gesture combinations. Further, the project can be merged into production in a Red Hen pipeline.",

          "description": "Currently InVesalius does not support simultaneous visualization of structural MRI and fMRI volumes. This is however of large interest to visualize both modalities for people involved in the clinical and analytical domain. Indeed a direct implication would be to have functional connectivity induced graphs visible along with structural connections (white matter). On top of which, after generating 3d maps, it may then be possible to visualize in space the functional connections versus structural connections. \n\nFirst of all, this project would be a useful feature to InVesalius, but secondly also to the neuroscience community. By having InVesalius open source and in a UI format it would enable clinical experts or neuroscientists without engineering background to have ready to go visualization of fMRI and structural MRI volumes. In general this could be extended to other modalities as well.\n\nTwo possible ways to simultaneously visualize structural MRI and fMRI are: \n\n1. Overlay different masks or contrasts (need to be carefully picked) for each of the two modality. There might be a need to apply some color distribution matching between structural and functional (e.g histogram equalization) since one would be T1 and the other T2 to have better visualization. Both slices would need to be co-registered prior to overlaying. The effect on the generation of 3D visualization would also be cared for.\n\n2. Having two views or preview of fMRI in each orientation (sagittal, coronal, axial and 3d).\n Two views or one main view and a preview would require to have a tracker (dot) that points to the same voxels in the two views. This could be a way for the user to match regions for instance and essentially avoid crowding the visualization.\n\nThe language I plan on using and believe fits the project would be python. The potential libraries used during the project would include already required ones for InVesalius (e.g scipy,opencv)",

          "description": "Picturing Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) is a tool used to store, retrieve and share medical images among healthcare professionals. PACS systems make it easier to manage medical images since it contains integration with Dicom standard, that implements the dimse protocol which is used to perform medical images retrieve/upload operations.\n\nInVesalius is a desktop tool that allows the visualization and tridimensional reconstructions of Computed Tomography and also Magnetic Resonance Imaging files. InVesalius allows uploading a set of images from CT or MRI and then it shows the Coronal, Sagittal and Axial planes and also allows the application of masks to reconstruct the images in three dimensions. Currently InVesalius does not have integration with PACS systems, this means that all the files are handled by the application.\n\nThe suggested proposal presents a schedule to integrate multiple PACS systems with InVesalius. The schedule includes all the steps needed to integrate both systems, aiming for usability and code maintainability.",

BYM is a highly flexible model for studying spatial data and is used widely in epidemiology, agriculture, and ecology. The strategy behind the BYM model is to treat the outcome of interest as the result of three factors: some set of predictor variables, spatial covariance between neighboring regions, and random effects that represent non-spatial heterogeneity.\n\nAlthough very flexible, the BYM model can be difficult to specify in a way that is simultaneously computationally efficient, interpretable, and identifiable. Recently, Morris et al (2019) demonstrated an alternative specification of the BYM model that is significantly more efficient, interpretable, and can be identified with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) samplers.\n\nDeveloping an implementation in Python with PyMC would make the model more accessible to a greater variety of users. Furthermore, BYM models are only available in a Bayesian framework. As a leading Bayesian statistics package, PyMC should support this extremely useful model in spatial statistics.",

          "description": "Bayesian modeling has increased significantly in academia and industry over the past years thanks to the development of high quality and user friendly open source probabilistic programming languages (PPL) in Python and R. Of these is Bambi, a Python library built on top of the PyMC PPL, that makes it easy to specify complex generalized linear multilevel models using a formula notation similar to those found in R. However, as the model building portion of the Bayesian workflow becomes easier, the interpretation of these models has not. Currently, to aid in model interpretability, Bambi only supports conditional adjusted predictions plots. The objective is to take inspiration from the existing Bambi tooling and R package marginaleffects, to extend upon existing plotting functionality and to provide additional plotting functions such as conditional comparisons and conditional marginal effects to allow Bambi modelers to extract insights and interpret their models in a more automatic and effective manner.",

An example might be to estimate an areal loading of active material necessary to compete with another active material, which has different capacity and potential. The different loading would also influence the entire cell and process design such that a coupled cell-process-cost model could give much more accurate and holistic cost estimates than single rules of thumb can. The coupling of cell and process can be achieved by decomposing the process into decoupled process units, which are then connected with cell parameters, e.g. areal loadings. The flexible submodel structure of PyBaMM would enable the use of independent “plug and play” economics e.g. for modeling different processes and economies of scale, as well as the combination of other PyBaMM models to estimate key values for degradation and thermal performance.

I parallelized multiple NetworkX functions in nx_parallel, and created the structure for future efforts to build out the parallel backend. \nIn addition, although the graph algorithms in NetworkX are well-documented, users benefit from explanations and example uses of the algorithms. To satisfy this need, NetworkX has created nx-guides, which are pedagogical Jupyter Notebooks that clearly explain and experimentally explore (with examples) algorithms implemented in NetworkX. I added a notebook to nx-guides where I explain the traversal algorithms provided by NetworkX. In addition, new contributors currently do not have a roadmap for contributing to nx-guides, as mentioned by @MridulS in community meeting notes.

          "description": "The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides many algorithms to sort, search, and perform a variety of operations on numerous data structures in its algorithms library. However, a major issue with the STL is that it is not optimized for parallel programming. Despite the fact that nearly all processors ship today with multithreading available, the STL is currently single threaded, leaving its algorithms library running at suboptimal efficiency. Taskflow is a C++ parallel programming library that organizes functions into tasks that it then can run concurrently or consecutively, depending on the user’s goal. My project will reimplement the STL’s algorithm library using Taskflow so that it can take advantage of multithreading.",

Based on that, the writer plans to implement the p-median model with near-far cost allocation. By this, the spopt package can provide more accurate and efficient solutions to spatial optimization problems, typically for the problems with large data points, and large demand volume.

Typically, this process is quite slow for large Disciplined Parametrized Programs(DPP). However, it is possible to improve upon the canonicalization by replacing the way 3D sparse tensors are represented.\nOne of the major updates of CVXPY 1.3 was the addition of a SciPy backend, which allowed a performance speedup for certain types of optimization problems. This new backend offers an alternative to the original C++ backend implementation (CVXCORE), and enables easier development. \nThe SciPy backend has some limitations especially when it comes to manipulating sparse tensors with 3 dimensions. The current representation of a 3D sparse tensor is to use a list of 2D matrices. However, a sparse tensor of large dimension could be represented as a single strided matrix, which can make CVXPY backend operations orders of magnitude more efficient.",

          "description": "Sustainability is a key goal for KDE over the next two years. As part of this goal, KDE aims to measure the energy consumption of its software and eco-certify applications with the Blue Angel ecolabel.\nCurrently, we measure the energy consumption of our software using a lab based in Berlin following the process documented in the KDE Eco Handbook (Handbook: Applying The Blue Angel Criteria To Free Software).\nThe lab setup requires (i) a test PC (System Under Test) to run user-emulation scripts, (ii) a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the test PC, and (iii) another PC (Data Aggregator & Evaluator) to collect and analyze the output data. In the current setup, developers must rely on individuals in Berlin to test software for them on-site in the lab.\nThis proposal aims to provide remote access to the lab in two steps: first, automating the energy measurement process, including providing a summary of the results; and second, setting up backend CI/CD integration for measuring energy consumption.\nBy automating the process and providing remote access, we make it possible for developers to measure the energy consumption of their software from any location in the world. The increased access to the lab will enable data-driven decision-making for efficiency improvements in code and software eco-certification with agencies like the Blue Angel.\nThe proposed project has three main goals:\ni) Measurement Automation: Implement a solution where a developer provides as input three scripts (baseline, idle mode, and standard usage scenario) with a config file and automatically obtains a summary of results from  OSCAR (Open source Software Consumption Analysis in R).\nii) Remote Access 1: Implement a CI/CD pipeline as a backend solution for performing the energy consumption measurements in the remote energy measurement lab.",

Optical flow is pivotal to many computer vision applications such as object tracking, video stabilization, and motion analysis, providing essential information about the dynamics of a scene or an object. With the upsurge in the use of deep neural networks, DNN models were developed to solve the optical flow problem, achieving state-of-the-art results by learning to estimate motion from image data. However, DNNs can become computationally expensive making it infeasible to be deployed on embedded systems. This problem is tackled by the development of lightweight DNN models. However, OpenCV model zoo hasn't had any implementation of an optical flow lightweight model yet. Thus, this project aims to find the best lightweight optical flow model in terms of model size, speed, and accuracy to introduce to the OpenCV model zoo.",

Although Existing realtime object tracking models could reach high speeds on edge devices, their performance is poor. Consequently, the high-performance tracker with fast speed on edge devices is critical. I have two plans to solve this problem. The first Scheme is to use the pre-trained lightweight transformer as the tracking models' backbone and through the proper design, the tracking model not only has good performance because of the use of the pre-trained visual transformer but also because the visual transformer used is lightweight and does not slow down the model due to the huge amount of computation caused by the transformer. The second Scheme is to build a small tracking model and pre-train the small tracking model using the MAE pre-training method, and finally, choose the current best-performing transformer-based tracking model as the teacher model to train the student model. Eventually, two state-of-the-art real-time tracking models will be provided, along with their code, and they will be maintained over time.",

This will involve using the COLMAP and OpenCV data processing pipelines in order to extract the camera poses and epipolar geometry of the scene; these are requirements for the model's ability to learn a meaningful representation of the given scene.\n\nSecond, build, train, and test the actual NeRF model. This will involve using PyTorch's built-in CUDA support and extensive usage of the PyTorch library as a whole in order to incorporate critical components of the NeRF architecture such as positional encoding, ray sampling, and regularization into our model design. This step will also include rendering procedures that will allow users to extract images/videos, depth maps, and other logging information such as the training loss curve from the fully trained model.\n\nThird, create simple and intuitive documentation on how to use both the data loaders and the NeRF code base. This will involve creating a page on OpenCV's documentation (via Doxygen) that will list out specific terminal commands that the user should use to train the model. It will also include a summary of required packages, recommended environment configurations, and links to other helpful resources such as YouTube video demonstrations, which will all be geared towards increasing the usability and accessibility of the pipeline.",

This tutorial will enable users to leverage the power of G-API more effectively, along with optimized image processing tasks and improved performance.\n\n\nThe G-API framework, developed by OpenCVQ, is designed to streamline image processing algorithm flow. Its primary objective is to create graphs that can support multiple backends, resulting in lightweight and fast image processing tasks. For instance, when running the algorithm flow on a GPU, optimized video memory access can reduce system overhead and enhance computational speed. To use G-API effectively, it is essential to (1) understand the framework's overall architecture and features, (2) compare its processing algorithms to those of other common frameworks, identify the unique benefits of each G-API function, and (3) combine these advantages and new features to enhance existing tutorials.",

This results in users relying on external tools or code to analyze and visualize their data, which can be time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. Thus, there is a critical gap in the platform's functionality that needs to be addressed.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo address this issue, a web-based user interface will be developed that will provide l an accessible and user-friendly platform for users to interact with and explore their vector data. This tool will allow users to quickly visualize their data, perform exploratory data analysis, and gain insights into their data without relying on external code. Additionally, a web-based interface will be more accessible to a broader range of users, including those without advanced programming or data analysis skills.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nThe proposed project aims to create a user-friendly web application with a comprehensive set of tools for managing and analyzing data. The application will be visually appealing, easy to use, and accessible on multiple devices. Documentation will also be provided to ensure ease of use and further development.

          "description": "Some of the most extreme and mysterious events in the universe like neutron star mergers, black hole accretions, and gamma-ray bursts are studied by the high energy radiations that they emit. Among all the brightness variations we can study in these sources, periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations are among the most interesting, because they can provide insights into the astrophysical processes in these objects. While the stingray package is a valuable tool for analyzing periodic data, its analysis of quasi-periodic data is limited by biases in frequency domain methods. To mitigate these limitations, a Gaussian process regression (a time domain method) can be used to model the time series for a kernel describing a QPO. Using Bayesian Inferencing, we can infer its parameters and assign them physical meaning related to the physics of the process and perform model selection between QPOs and alternative models. This can be used to reliably detect QPOs, and infer their physical properties. Such methods have already been implemented in recent papers (Huebner et al,2022), and the goal of this project will be to simplify their code and implement it in Stingray using the Tinygp library for the GP backend. It will also be accompanied by a tutorial and a demonstration on various datasets.",

          "description": "RADIS  is a fast line-by-line code for synthesizing and fitting infrared absorption and emission spectra, such as encountered in laboratory plasmas or exoplanet atmospheres. It uses a line-by-line approach, where each absorption or emission line of a molecule is computed by accounting for the influence of environmental parameters. High-temperature spectral calculations require resolving the shape of tens of millions of lines, which is the usual performance bottleneck. RADIS implements a new algorithm to compute these lineshapes and is already one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available. It can also compute many different types of spectra (absorption/emission/equilibrium / non-equilibrium). \n\nHowever, although the algorithm is very CPU/GPU efficient, the RADIS code is still memory hungry. Databases are currently loaded in RADIS using the VAEX [3] package, but the operations to calculate the spectra are performed using the PANDAS library. VAEX is a similar table management tool to PANDAS but uses memory mapping, a zero-memory copy policy, and lazy computations for the best performance. \n\n The main goal of the current project is to refactor RADIS so that dataframes are only manipulated via the VAEX format. Potentially, this work would make it possible to compute spectral databases of up to billions of lines (hundreds of GB or terabyte-scale databases).",

X-ray data may not always be evenly spaced. For example when Earth regularly blocks the object of interest as the space telescope orbits the Earth or when the instrument has faults due to system malfunction or cosmic rays hitting the instrument sensors. When the data is evenly spaced, we can use the Fourier domain methods such as power spectrum and cross spectrum in practical time frames to decompose the signal into its various periodic elements. But when the data is unevenly spaced we cannot use the same methods.\n\nLomb Scargle Periodograms and Cross Spectra can be used for analyzing unevenly spaced data. There are various ways to optimize the Lomb Scargle Periodogram's runtime speed such as those introduced by William H. Press and George B.

          "description": "Abstract\n\nUltimate Alarm Clock is a mobile app that aims to provide features that other alarm clocks don’t have such as conditional alarms based on location, phone activity, weather, or shared settings. Besides these, the clock will also include unique features to dismiss the alarm such as scanning a QR/Bar code, solving simple math problems of varying difficulty or shaking the phone. This is an open-source, free, and ad-free project that's built with Flutter.\n\nProposed Deliverables\n\n- A Flutter application that runs as a foreground service and uses Firestore as its database which would hold all the alarms created by the user.\n- This app would allow users to set conditional alarms by tracking their phone activity, location, weather or shared settings.\n- It would also enable users to set up unique challenges such as scanning a QR/Bar code, solving simple mathematical questions of varying difficulty or shaking the phone to dismiss the alarm.\n- Set up end-to-end testing using GitHub Actions to ensure that the application does not break in Android or iOS.\n\nAdditionally, if time permits, I'd also like to work on the following features:\n\n- Implementing some other features such as showing the weather forecast or motivational quotes on the dismissed screen. \n- Making an option to allow users to set quick alarms (alarms relative to the current time, say 10 minutes from now) with intervals (say 6 alarms at an interval of 10 minutes between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM)\n\nPlan of Implementation\n\nTo implement the core functionalities, I will set up the application as a foreground service which will ensure that the alarms set will persist through reboots.\n\nThe unique features such as conditional alarms or dismissal challenges can be implemented using open source packages such as weather, location, and so on.",

This project aims to make the serialization framework easier to use and extend by changing the way the serialize, serialize_into and deserialize functions work to dispatch to supported types implicitly without the need for an if-else ladder.\n\nAnd the project also aims to implement support for additional data types like\ngeneric routines for map, vector and complex numbers. This would enable\nmore easily serializing ENIGMA's internal state for use in sending state\neither across a network or into a file.\n\nAdditionally, the project aims to introduce support for the JSON format within the serialization system, offering it as a new option alongside the existing bytes format.

          "description": "Accurate gene annotation in eukaryotes solely based on genomic data has been a significant obstacle in biology since the introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies and thus the rapid increase of available data. Traditional methods either rely on homology searches to map the open reading frames to previously identified protein-coding genes or utilize additional experimental data, e.g., transcriptomics data. The first approach produces potentially inaccurate results if the genome of interest is not at least somewhat related to an already annotated genome. The second approach is hindered because gathering transcriptomic data is labor-intensive and expensive. For that reason, there is a high demand for models that predict the location of protein-coding genes solely from inherent features of the DNA sequence of the gene. Although theoretically possible, methods that use, for instance, Hidden Markov models to detect protein-coding genes based on known gene features are often inaccurate. In this project, we will train a Deep Learning Transformer model to extract features of protein-coding genes to gain deeper insight into their exact properties that lead to translation. The whole workflow will include first training a Conditional Random Field model to recognize candidate gene regions and then using these as input for a more fine-grained Transformer - Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model. The final pipeline will be tested against a benchmark of gold standard annotations as well as various test sets to evaluate the influence of different parameters like genome sequence quality, protein length or gene structure complexity.",

Preventing potentially wrong transcripts and gene annotation is essential to the science community as many rely on the annotation for decision-making. Automated workflow with a has been developed to minimise the time needed to verify and annotated those transcript variants. However, current workflows are developed using a very strict rule-set and hence many of the novel transcript variants were rejected.\nTo address issue that strict filters rejects most of the legitimate introns,\nwe developed IntronOrNot (ION) - a machine learning to differentiate that predicts\nif the intron is real or misaligned. The model accepts coordinates, .bed, and .gtf file as input. The prediction script is easy to use and achieved comparable results\nto sequence-based deep learning intron predictor.

The pipeline will be designed to handle genome chunking and multiprocessing to ensure efficient use of computational resources.\n\nThe pipeline will take a genome sequence in FASTA format as input and use the RepeatModeler tool to generate a de novo repeat library for the input genome sequence. It will then use RepeatMasker to mask and annotate the repeats in the input genome sequence. Additionally, it will use Dust to mask and annotate low complexity sequences and TRF to mask and annotate tandem repeats in the input genome sequence. The pipeline will combine the results from these steps to output a masked genome sequence in FASTA format and annotated repeats in GTF format.\n\nFurthermore, the pipeline will use the tool RED to perform additional masking and output an additional masked genome sequence in FASTA format. The pipeline will be deployed in the cloud using the Embassy Cloud within the EMBL-EBI infrastructure to allow for testing and scaling, with the aim of determining the cost of running it at scale.\n\nThe main problem that this proposal aims to solve is the challenge of identifying and masking repetitive elements in large and complex genome sequences. The pipeline will provide a detailed and informative annotation of the repeats within the genome, making it easier for researchers to analyze the non-repetitive regions of the genome.\n\nThe deliverables of this proposal will include a NextFlow pipeline for repeat annotation and masking, a de novo repeat library for the input genome sequence, a masked genome sequence in FASTA format with repeat, low complexity, and tandem repeat annotations, an annotated repeats file in GTF format, and an additional masked genome sequence in FASTA format generated using the tool RED.",

The project will identify strings related to runtime and library code for targeted programming languages and extend standard output format to render the results. The successful completion of this project will make FLOSS more useful for security analysts and manifest its success as the default tool used for malware analysis.",

          "description": "CAPA is the FLARE team’s open-source tool to identify program capabilities using an extensible rule set. Each rule is matched against features that CAPA extracts from a program. Extracted features include file-level features such as strings, section names, imports, and exports and function-level features such as API calls, string and byte references, instruction mnemonics, and number constants.\n\nCAPA uses feature extractors, called \"backends\", to extract features from supported file types (PE, ELF, and .NET) and architectures (32- and 64-bit x86). Each backend is built around an existing tool or library that provides file parsing and disassembly capabilities. CAPA uses this to extract features. CAPA currently implements backends using Vivisect, IDA Pro, and dnfile.\n\nGhidra is a popular open-source disassembly framework with a robust API to access its analysis. Programs can interact with a wealth of information that includes parsed file formats and disassembled code. The goal of this project is to develop a Ghidra backend for CAPA using Python 3 (via Ghidrathon) and Ghidra’s scripting API. Users should be able to invoke CAPA such that it uses Ghidra’s analysis engine and/or invoke CAPA from within Ghidra.",

          "description": "capa is an open-source tool that identifies program capabilities using an extensible rule set. Currently, the project relies purely on static analysis of code structures to identify patterns. This project extends capa to work on dynamic execution data such as sandbox run traces or code emulation analysis.\n\nThe introduction of dynamic analysis to capa is set to make analyzing samples that feature anti-analysis techniques a much easier task. This is an issue of concern since a large number of distributed software nowadays gets packed with commercial or private packers, which means that capa would fail to profile these executables' capabilities successfully. However, this can be circumvented by introducing dynamic analysis to the problem, which it would enable capa to get a view of the program after it had been unpacked in memory, thereby making it possible to extract the capabilities from the executable at hand.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Add support for the future integration of several sandbox solutions by means of an associated feature extractor.\n2. Implement a feature extractor for the Cuckoo-based CAPE Malware Configuration and Payload Extractor.\n3. Introduce capa features that are specific to dynamic analysis (such as captured network traffic).\n4. Add dynamic-based support for function call arguments.\n5. Write novel rules that make use of the newly introduced dynamic capability extraction.",

          "description": "SQLancer randomly generates test cases consisting of potentially hundreds or thousands of SQL statements. In order to efficiently identify bugs in these statements, automatic reduction is needed to  systematically remove the bug inducing statements until a minimal bug-triggering test case is derived.\n\nTo improve the efficiency and effectiveness of SQLancer for bug detection and resolution in various DBMSs, I propose to undertake the following tasks:\n\n1. Implement delta-debugging algorithms for statement reduction in SQLancer to improve efficiency and speed.\n2. Define parser-tree transforms to simplify SQL statements. Since SQL syntax varies among DBMSs, generic parser-tree transforms that can be applied across multiple DBMSs will be implemented, such as removing expression nodes or removing certain clauses from the statement.\n3. Generalize statement reduction to additional DBMSs by adding bug reproducers to them.\n\nThe deliverables for this project include:\n\n1. A delta-debugging algorithm that can reduce the bug-inducing statement.\n2. Generic parser-tree transforms that simplify SQL statements.\n3. Support of statement reduction for more DBMSs.",

          "description": "SMT solvers are widely utilized in computer-guided verification of computer programs and artificial intelligence. With a multitude of theories employed in these solvers, it is beneficial to have access to a diverse range of solvers and to minimize the challenge of learning a new API for each of them. Using the solver’s own API directly makes it difficult to switch to another solver without rewriting extensive parts of the application, as there is no standardized binary API for SMT solvers. Also, since these SMT solvers have varying degrees of capabilities and performance and may not accept the same input, frameworks were created, that offer a unified API to several SMT solvers.\nJavaSMT has exactly these attributes, a common API for SMT solvers. The framework provides access to a variety of solvers created using Java and other programming languages. Although most solvers share a common set of supported theories and features, their availability of extra theories and performance may differ. Therefore, the inclusion of additional solvers in the framework is advantageous to its users.\n\nSMT formulas over the real numbers can encode a wide range of problems in theorem proving and formal verification. Such formulas are very hard to solve when nonlinear functions are involved. For that reason, the SMT solver dReal will be implemented in JavaSMT.\nThe SMT solver dReal is a solver that solves nonlinear formulas over the reals. The solver can handle various nonlinear real functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, etc. \nThe goal of the project will be to integrate the SMT solver dReal into the JavaSMT framework and to include it in the existing JavaSMT tests.",

The Higgs boson which is a heavy and highly unstable elementary particle is not present in nature but is generated in high energy collisions. Because it’s unstable and decays before reaching the edge of the detector, we study it by observing its decay products which tend to form conical jets and then reconstruct the Higgs bosons from these observations. One technique we might use to reconstruct these particles is to pass the kinematic variables (momentum, energy, etc.) to a transformer autoencoder while masking either subsets of kinematics or the kinematics for an entire particle.

SSL can also create meaningful representations from very vast unlabelled datasets that would be challenging or impossible to label manually.

These physics-based features are integrated into a Vision Transformer (ViT) neural network, providing a nuanced understanding of different dark matter structures like Cold Dark Matter and No-Substructure Dark Matter, and their associated gravitational imprints on light paths and galaxy distortions. To validate the model, we generate a specialized dataset using real galaxy images as source objects and benchmark Lensiformer against other leading models, confirming its superior performance in discerning different kinds of dark matter morphologies.",

          "description": "Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the data generated at the European Council for Nuclear Research's (CERN) Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which produces immense amounts of data through the measurement of the products of particle collisions. Since data from these events can typically be formed into a graph structure, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been used as an approach to various HEP anlysis tasks. One such task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. To enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, embedded symmetries, which are present in many physically realizable datasets and fundamental physical theories, can also be discovered by the model through the use of invariant I(n) and equivariant networks E(n). However, due to the increasing size and complexity of these datasets, as well as the models which process them, an involved yet computationally inexpensive approach must be utilized. To handle an increase in the complexity of the data, I suggest the implementation of a classical attention (AT) transformer with the necessary modifications to incorporate, invariant or equivariant, and GNN layers. As the extension of classical algorithms via bit-wise processes to quantum algorithms via qubit-wise processes has been rapidly developing over the last few years, I propose the full development of general quantum invariant and equivariant graph attention transformer (QIGAT or Quantum Informer, QEGAT or Quantum Equiformer) architectures to meet the demands of requiring these machine learning algorithms to offer enhanced robustness through the adherence to fundamental physical principles while reducing their computational cost.",

As a developer, I have the necessary skills and expertise to work with both the Legacy codebase and the Laravel framework. I will work closely with the LibreHealth EHR team to ensure that any required adjustments to the current codebase are made to ensure compatibility with the new framework.\n\nIn addition to the code migration, I am committed to enhancing the User Interface of the User's Module. With my extensive experience in UI/UX design, I will work closely with the LibreHealth EHR team to gather feedback on the current UI and design an updated version that aligns with their needs. I believe that this will enhance the overall user experience and make the application more user-friendly.\n\nFinally, I understand the importance of documentation in ensuring that developers can easily understand and work with the codebase. As such, I will update and improve the project's documentation to ensure that other developers can easily understand the codebase and contribute to the project. I will document the migration process, including any adjustments made to the current codebase, to ensure that it is clear and understandable to other developers.\n\nIn summary, I am excited to contribute to the LibreHealth EHR project by migrating the User's Module to the new Laravel codebase, revamping the User Interface, and updating the documentation.

One common complication of prematurity is neonatal hypothermia, which can be effectively treated with Kangaroo Mother Care/Skin-to-Skin care (KMC/STS). However, the implementation of KMC/STS is limited by various barriers such as inadequate healthcare workforce and the labor-intensive nature of neonatal care, leading to inconsistent scale-up of KMC/STS.\n\nThe goal of this project is to developed to automate vital sign monitoring, facilitate multi-patient tracking, and enable shared goal setting for education, KMC, and discharge. The primary aim of this application is to provide timely alerts to parents and caregivers upon detecting any abnormality in vital signs, thus preventing adverse outcomes.

It communicates with LibreHealth RIS module to output labels on DICOM viewer.\n\nCurrently, CheXnet model is integrated to the AI Model service, but the proposal expands to apply other models to imaging modalities like Mammo, Head CT, Abdomen CT. The project aims to understand what radiologists need in terms of AI and implement it. The goal is to help radiologists perform better by implementing algorithms for new imaging modalities.\n\nTo tackle the problem we start by looking at research that have looked deep into model architectures and methods that work well with imaging modalities, for example Alexnet have proven to work on modalities like Head CT. We then collect the imaging data necessary to train out models and also decide on the method of training like transfer learning on pretrained models or do we go ahead with training a model from scratch. Appropriate feature engineering and tuning will be part of the problem solving process. Once we establish a model to perform well on a modality we proceed to integrate the model to the AI Model service application.\n\nThe deliverables will include\n- Collate information on data sources, methods and models that will be used for implementation and review with mentor(s)\n- For any modality, start with data preparation, feature engineering, training and evaluation until satisfactory performance is achieved. Here we will trial different augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning methods. \n- Integrate the model inferencing code and retraining code to the application for all modalities\n- Add methods to the Flask API to appropriately call the specific AI model for a modality. Modify existing methods as necessary so as to include the new AI models\n- Perform unit tests, integration tests, functional tests and end to end tests for the implementations. Necessary coding standards will be used.",

The project involves developing Flows with TL-Verilog (Makerchip IDE or SandPiper-SaaS) and integrating them into the website or use as a standalone flow. This involves developing support for tools and creating flows in Edalize. This effort Makerchip Flows also extends to adding TL-Verilog frontend for Silicon Compiler. This wide range of support and ecosystem developments will make TL-Verilog and its ecosystem the go-to for Design, Simulations, FPGA visualizations, and other explorations just within the browser, creating a low cost and low barrier to entry for beginners and engineers.",

          "description": "Live performances and concerts promote a sense of uniqueness. It happens for two main reasons: the relationship between the artist and the public; and the relationship between the audience itself. It is a space in time where artists respond to the public as much as the public responds to the artists. Also, every person in the audience is surrounded by other people having similar feelings and sensations. \n\nSearching to create related energy and experience via live performances in Extended Reality, this proposal aims to develop a platform prototype to generate a fluid XR experience for users by reliving live performances through motion capture. The key technologies for this goal are: MediaPipe Pose, open source software for pose detection in a live streaming context, and WebXR for the development and hosting of virtual reality and augmented reality experiences on the web.\n\nLive performances have no analog due to their unique energy and feeling of shared experience. XR's experience with concerts and live performances does not necessarily wants to exist as a copy of performances in real-life, but as a proposal of different interactions. Therefore Extended Reality can create its paradigm in art and technology.",

          "description": "SATIE(Spatial Audio Toolkit for Immersive Environments) can be used for audio spatialization. It is an audio spatialization engine programmed in SuperCollider that can render dense audio scenes to large multi-channel loudspeaker systems in real time. This lower-level audio rendering process maintains a dynamic DSP graph created and controlled via OSC messages from the external process.\n\n\nSATIE can be used not only for sound object control (location, propagation, etc.) but it can also be used for Haptic Floor dedicated to large immersive spaces. In this project, however, we focus on a function of SATIE is that implementing geometry understanding at a spatializer level. In this case, we usually apply the current version of SATIE mappers plugin to perform this function. A mapper plugin does not process audio, it can be used for provide for non-generic control and geometric computation of lower-level spatialization parameters. However, it still has limitations that need to be programmed for each use case. In order to perfect it and improve its efficiency, we need to design and implement the generalizable SATIE mappers that could get all loaded spatializers and set them at a relative distance concerning each other. In other words, it is necessary to make each different spatializer in different positions recognize the relative position of each other. The proposed mappers will be designed to overcome these limitations and will be tested with different spatializer configurations. This project will provide SATIE with a powerful and flexible tool that will enable users to create rich and diverse sound spatial effects in different scenarios.",

To do this it is envisioned to replace direct use of OpenGL with an intermediate, multi-API rendering library.\n\n\n\nWork Done: 1) Investigating available rendering libraries and APIs supported by the Raspberry Pi 4. 2) Modifying Splash's OpenGL 4.5 code to work with OpenGL ES and thus the Raspberry Pi 4. 3) Merging the old OpenGL and the new OpenGL ES codepaths to allow one binary to run both. 4).

          "description": "It is easy to render fonts well on screens with high pixel density.  However, straightforward algorithms run into problems when rendering with few pixels available.  For example, fonts where the capital “O” is taller than the capital “T”, or vice versa, should have these characters rendered at the same height when few pixels are available to avoid bumpy-looking text.  Many modern font formats  contain “hints” in these cases, which tell the renderer how it should align each symbol in the font to the pixel grid to create the most legible and consistent rendering.  However, not all fonts and font formats contain hints.  In these cases, the auto-hinter can be enabled, which analyzes the shapes in the font to fix some common issues that would normally be fixed by manually added hints.  This project aims to further improve this process by adding corrections for specific letters, such as “i”, where the dot can merge with the stem, and “ñ”, where the tilde can lose its shape and become flat.  These changes would be described in a capabilities database with a format designed as part of the project.",

          "description": "cBioPortal allows submission of data sets to enrich its open-access cancer genomics database. Currently, new data sets can be uploaded to a separate repository for further review. However, to ensure full quality assurance, new data sets must be manually imported into an instance of cBioPortal and visually inspected to ensure the data displays correctly. This manual step is tedious, and presents a barrier to easily reviewing new submissions. \n\nTo resolve this bottleneck in the review process, the proposed solution will create a new workflow that will trigger upon a new submission to automatically deploy a live staging instance of cBioPortal, with the new data set already imported. Time permitting, a second potential workflow could also be explored to further streamline the process by generating resources such as screenshots for easier visual inspection. These improvements would allow cBioPortal maintainers to more easily validate new submissions, leading to faster approvals for new data, and a higher quality database for cancer researchers.",

Touchless gesture-based intuitive systems can reduce transmission in public settings and workplaces, and offer a seamless and convenient experience. Touchless technology is expected to remain popular in various industries, such as retail, healthcare, and hospitality. \n\nIn this proposal, I suggest developing an interactive web app using the Mediapipe Hands JS Solution API and simple human gestures to provide perfect contactless interactions with interfaces. The app will showcase an augmented transaction panel previewed on the screen, enabling users to perform essential CRUD operations of items through custom simple-to-use gestures, without physical touch. Both custom defined & pre-trained gestures from Mediapipe’s tasks-vision API will be utilized to classify gestures and trigger events on the interface. \n\nThe project targets most platforms, primarily big screens, and may run on selective mobile devices with a camera module for input feed.

In this project, the objective is to expand the capabilities of Apothesis by adding hexagonal and diamond lattices to enable the simulation of more complex materials and processes.\r\n\r\nThe addition of these new lattice structures will allow Apothesis to simulate a wider range of materials and enable the development of new technologies that can streamline or enhance thin film deposition processes. The project will involve researching the hexagonal and diamond lattice structures, developing the necessary code, and testing the implementation. The end result will be a more robust and versatile software tool for scientists and engineers working in thin film deposition processes.",

Develop a M2M transformation tool that can automatically generate intent examples from OpenAPI descriptions. 2. Automate the creation of intent examples from OpenAPI descriptions directly in the dflow platform.

Currently, XaoS requires the user to download and install the software, which limits its accessibility.

Browsers typically run JavaScript, which is single-threaded and relies on asynchronous events to avoid blocking the main thread, making the current implementation unsuitable. The proposed solution is to use a QTimer to periodically update the fractal using UIH functions.

It allows users to safely backup keys by giving shares to various independent escrow providers, and recover the secret by passing user-selected authentication challenges at a sufficiently large subset of these providers. GNU Taler is a digital payments system that uses cryptography to provide a certain degree of anonymity when paying things online.\n\nSome of the private keys that GNU Taler uses to represent money must be stored locally in the wallets, and thus, it is important to provide users with a way to ensure availability and confidentiality of these keys to avoid financial loss.\n\nThis proposal consists on the integration of GNU Anastasis in the Android wallet app of GNU Taler in order to allow users to make secure and decentralized backups of their digital wallets, and to recover the wallet data without relying on the user to safeguard their key material.\n\nGNU Anastasis' client logic is already available in TypeScript, just like the cryptographic core of the GNU Taler wallet.  Thus, to make this work, we need to link the GNU Anastasis client logic into the GNU Taler wallet and then systematically expose its functionality to the user interface implemented in Kotlin.\n\nIdeally, the resulting code should be re-usable outside of the GNU Taler wallet, for example as a stand-alone Android app to backup other key material or as re-usable Android dialogs that can be integrated with other Android apps in need for key backup and recovery functionality.",

          "description": "Many bug reports from almost 10 years ago to even recent times report that GNU Lilypond has been unable to correctly render note subdivision beams and tuple subdivisions, more evidently in some cases of complex rhythm and meter. After comprehensive assessment and analysis of these issues by the developers, the developers have determined that the current code responsible for those capabilities  should be rewritten and refactored.\n\nThe reason that note subdivision and beaming can be difficult to implement is that music theory heavily relies on powers of 2 and their reciprocals. It's very convenient to composers, instrument players and developers too. That convenience doesn't address the problems rhythmic complexity can pose. Concepts such as compound time signatures, tuplets (group of notes that are not bounded by the powers of 2) and manually setting relevant Lilypond attributes. My project proposes a new way of  representing the concept of music theory beams and groupings with different object attributes.\n\nMy project proposes to fix this Lilypond issue by rewriting `lily/beaming-pattern.cc` (the C++ source file mostly responsible for this issue's logic) and fixing/refactoring relevant C++/Scheme source files. I plan to first refactor such source files to fix regular note automatic subdivision and beaming, then fix tuplet subdivision in later weeks. Heavy code modifications will include updating documentation, adding regression tests, and formatting Lilypond's `convert-ly` rules corresponding to the above two issues.\n\nOnce the issue of beaming subdivisions is fixed, developers and even anyone wishing to compose rhythmically-complex scores should not have to worry about this obstacle.",

Currently, there is no official Rust support for GNU/Hurd, which limits developers' ability to build high-performance, safe, and concurrent software on this platform. The Rust language is increasingly being used in fundamental libraries such as librsvg and python-cryptography, so it is crucial to have a compiler for Rust on GNU/Hurd. The Rust compiler is portable, but its runtime library, libstd, needs to be ported to GNU/Hurd. This involves telling Rust how to call standard C library functions, which can be generated from libc C headers using the bindgen tool. The proposed solution involves creating a new Rust target for GNU/Hurd by investigating the system calls and interfaces available in GNU/Hurd and adapting Rust's code generator to generate code that uses these interfaces. The project aims to optimize Rust's performance on the GNU/Hurd platform by identifying performance bottlenecks and implementing improvements where necessary. The deliverables of the project include the Rust-GNU/Hurd toolchain, which comprises the Rust compiler and libraries, documentation, and optimized performance of Rust on the GNU/Hurd platform.

          "short_description": "LuCI is a framework used to build web interfaces for configuration and monitoring on embedded devices such as WiFi routers, etc. In the old CBI based...",
          "description": "LuCI is a framework used to build web interfaces for configuration and monitoring on embedded devices such as WiFi routers, etc. In the old CBI based system, pages were rendered on the router and delivered as HTML to the browser, leading to a higher load on the embedded devices. To address this issue, LuCI applications must be migrated to JavaScript-based framework to reduce the load on embedded devices and improve performance. This migration involves rendering pages on the client-side using JavaScript, rather than on the router. To facilitate this migration, LuCI provides a JavaScript API that will be used to build web interfaces that can be rendered in the browser. To make this migration possible, new RPCD services will be developed to provide data to the client side that was formerly used directly on the router. This data will be provided in JSON format via RPCD (Remote Procedure Call Daemon) and UBUS. These new RPCD services will need to provide the same functionality as the old system but in a format that can be used by client-side JavaScript.\nThe migration of LuCI to JavaScript-based framework will offer several benefits to OpenWrt community and other users of OpenWrt-based devices. One of the primary benefits is improved performance and reduced load on embedded devices such as WiFi routers. By rendering pages on the client-side using JavaScript, rather than on the router, this will reduce the workload on the router and improve the UX for those interacting with the LuCI web interface. This will be particularly beneficial for users with lower-specification routers etc. Another benefit of the new system is increased flexibility for developers. The use of a client-side JavaScript framework provides developers with more options for customizing and extending the LuCI web interface. And this also provides a standardized way for developers to interact with the router's services which should make it easier to develop and maintain LuCI-based applications.",

It would be very useful if this could be abstracted away by a generic build system. This project proposes integration with OpenSUSE's OpenBuildService, which also provides automation and remote compilation.\n\nThe plan currently looks like the following:\n1. Document the existing approaches on automating the build system.\n2. Write a build script that integrates with the obs-build repository.\n3. Get security approval, as documented in https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build/blob/master/HOWTO.add_another_format.\n4.

          "description": "The IEEE 802.11 specification for Wireless Local Area Networking (WLAN) has been\nwidely deployed worldwide due to its low cost and convenience in providing internet access. As such, the performance of WiFi networks is far from optimal, especially when multiple participants share the same channel in an uncoordinated manner. Hence, resource allocation in wireless transmission plays a vital role in optimizing the throughput of a link.\n\nThe aim of this project is to implement a joint power and rate controller in user space using the Rateman Python package. As a rate control algorithm in user space has already been developed at SupraCoNeX, namely \"py_minstrel_ht\", this variant of Minstrel-HT can be extended with power tuning capability to better manage interference and increase spatial reuse. In general, the proposed joint controller will consist of a power tuning module that tweaks the power level of the set of best rates, selected by the Minstrel-HT, to an optimal value. Furthermore, the joint controller could also be extended to support modes such as fixed power and low power.",

The application offers a unique way to visualize satellite orbits using the Liquid Galaxy rig (Google Earth) and a real-world Arduino-controlled pointer. It also provides insights into satellites' movements and access to vital satellite information seamlessly within the app.\n\nI plan to develop this by getting all the satellite data from SatNOGS database through API calls. Then, we use SGP-4 model to convert TLE of a satellite to get the state (position and velocity). Then we convert the satellite state to KML format. We segregate the KML data into the various tracks to get a neater visualization of the satellite's orbit data. Then, we write the code to send KML data from our Flutter app to the Liquid Galaxy to visualize this data on the Liquid Galaxy rig.  \n\nNext, we make Arduino controlled pointer which emits green laser in the direction of satellite, which is controlled by the app.  First, we 3D print the STL files of the 3D projector. Then, we assemble all the components of the Arduino-controlled pointer. Then, for the application, we use flutter_bluetooth_serial package to connect and send data to HC-05 module.

This will include writing examples, documentation, and tests. DG method is a FEM like the continuous Galerkin (CG) method where the test functions are chosen to be the same as the trial functions. However, DG elements do not share degrees of freedom (DoF) at common nodes, introducing extra DoF and adding the process of choosing coupling between elements through numerical fluxes. \nThe main deliverables are:\n• Methods to integrate on inner faces.\n• Extend the methods to integrate over subfaces.\n• Sparsity pattern methods for DG.\n• Implement infrastructure for handling boundary conditions for DG approximations.\n• 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D steady heat equation using DG example.\n• Testing and documentation for all implemented methods.",

To address this issue, it is essential to implement a CAPTCHA solution in the live chat widget. The objective of this project is to integrate a customizable CAPTCHA mechanism in the live chat feature of RocketChat to prevent spam messages from being sent. The proposed solution involves offering complete customization options to the admin, allowing them to select the captcha service that best fits their needs. This will be achieved by integrating three different CAPTCHA solutions: Cloudflare captcha, Google reCAPTCHA v2, and v3. The deliverables of this project include the integration of captcha widgets using Cloudflare and Google reCAPTCHA V2 and V3 in the Rocket Chat live chat feature, customizability options for the admin to select the captcha service according to their requirements, a comprehensive testing suite to ensure that the CAPTCHA is working correctly, and a user guide to help users understand how to use the new CAPTCHA feature in the live chat widget.",

This will save time and effort for developers who are new to app development and help them get started quickly.\n\n\nThe second feature is the implementation of a project concept where multiple screens can be grouped, saved, and revisited at a later time. This will enable developers to work on different parts of the app separately and easily switch between them.\n\n\nThe third feature is the use of the flow concept from https://reactflow.dev. This will allow each project to be represented as a flow, with each screen represented by a block. Actions can be connected to other blocks to visualise the app's lifecycle. This will make the development process more visual and easier to understand.\n\n\nThe last feature is the ability to \"compile the flow\" and run it as a demo. This will allow developers to quickly present a mock or app to validate its usefulness. This will save time and effort for developers who want to get feedback on their app quickly.\n\n\nOverall, Playground 2.0 is an app development platform that makes the development process faster, more visual, and easier to understand.

The goal is to provide developers with an effective means of debugging their asynchronous and concurrent code. To achieve this objective, an IntelliJ IDEA plugin will be developed that will communicate with the Kotlin compiler during a debugging session. The plugin will be able to retrieve relevant information about coroutines at any state of the program and leverage this information to generate a parallel stacks view. This will provide developers with a comprehensive overview of the execution flow of their coroutines, allowing them to more effectively identify and resolve issues in their code. Overall, this project represents a significant advancement in the toolset available to Kotlin developers, enabling them to build more reliable and performant coroutine-based applications.",

Plane wave sources are a useful tool in multiple different scenarios of electromagnetic simulations, especially when the wave is emitted by a source that is quite far away from the target or maybe even multiple targets. Currently, such a source does not exist in gprMax. This project will involved translating existing code written by one of the mentors, taking the idea that has been shown to work as a MATLAB script and place it in a much larger environment, gprMax, in Python, blending it seamlessly with the other sources available in gprMax.

          "description": "The current state of the asynchronous I/O on the JVM involves using separate selector threads to manage I/O events through system functions like epoll or kqueue. Although frameworks like Netty and NIO2 make this approach seem reasonable, the use of separate event loop threads is not without cost. In high-RPS services, these threads can compete for CPU time with worker threads executing application tasks, leading to resource contention and potentially significant performance loss. In contrast, Cats Effect offers a different threading model, integrating I/O and application tasks into a single runtime system, reducing contention an enhancing overall efficiency.\n\nio_uring, the key component of this project, offers two major advantages: (1) it enables all supported syscalls to become asynchronous from the application’s perspective, allowing for multiple syscalls to be initiated in parallel without blocking the calling thread, and (2) it uses a pair of ring buffers for syscall submission and completion events that are shared between the application and the kernel, dramatically reducing the overhead of calling from userspace into kernelspace. When integrated with Cats Effect, io_uring can significantly improve the efficiency of syscalls, requiring fewer calls into kernelspace during the worker loop. \n\nThis proposal brings two key innovations together: a new threading model and a new I/O API. By integrating Cats Effects and FS2 with io_uring, we aim to develop an alternative solution to minimize the inefficiencies found in the traditional model, offering a more efficient and performant solution for I/O-intensive applications.",

The API should be flexible and extensible, allowing users to easily add new types of plots, customize the appearance and layout, and apply different data transformations. To achieve these goals, we will use the tagless final style and composition, which enables us to combine multiple interfaces.\n2) Graph Adjustments Support: these features can help improve the clarity and usefulness of the plots and graphs we create. These features include axis limits, line width, marker style, transparency, color scheme, legends, annotations, axis scale, aspect ratio, etc.\n3) Documentation: in addition to written documentation, we will provide visual examples and demos that are extremely helpful in illustrating how to use the API.

Scala 3 supports a powerful yet type-safe macro system that allows analysis of the structure of code fragments via quote pattern matching.\n\nIn this project, we aim for two goals:\n1. The current implementation of quote pattern matching does not have many tests and is expected to be unstable. I propose making the feature more reliable by creating a checklist that captures which language features should be supported and adding more automated tests based on the checklist.\n2. The current quote pattern matching does not support extraction of polymorphic functions. I propose extending HOAS patterns to support pattern matching against polymorphic functions based on formal\ndefinitions.",

          "description": "Overview\nThis project aims to create a tool for Apache PMCs that will automate analysis of contributor activity in any given Apache repository.\nProject Goal\nThe project goal is to make it easy for PMCs to manage their communities. We will try to achieve this by developing a tool that automatically finds and tracks first (or 3rd, or 10th) pull requests in a specified repository on Github that belongs to a specific community. The idea is that the PMC can take this data and send “Thank you” notes or emails to new people that joined the community and made their first contribution. If these automatic reports show that there are contributors with consistent commits to the project, PMC can send them encouragement emails to keep up the good work and become committers, etc. \nProject Description \nThe tool will be based on using Github API to retrieve a list of all pull requests in the specified repository. Users will be able to set search parameters such as repository name and filters by pull request status.\nUsers can use this tool to:\nTrack pull requests in their own repositories \nTrack issues opened in their own repositories\nTrack the activity of individual contributors to encourage them to improve\nThe tool will provide a user-friendly interface for searching and filtering valuable community information, such as pull requests, issues, questions in StackOverflow and others. Users will also be able to configure notifications to receive alerts about new pull requests.\nTechnical Details\nThe tool will be developed in Python and will use the Github API directly to fetch data (another possibility is using the  PyGithub library to interact with Github API, however this may not be necessary). For the user interface, we can use the Flask or Django framework. The tool will be deployed on a web server and will be accessible through a browser.",

Agent is the core of this distributed system which does the heavy lifting of transfer jobs. Right now, agents have to be manually deploy and configure to start the transfer. This is a problem for researchers and people who need to transfer data without having much technical skills or time.\n\nUpdated Proposal Summary:\nUpdated proposal includes creating a desktop application and cybershuttle server to orchestrate the lifecycle management. This will guide cybershuttle agent and MFT agent from cybershuttle server to perform execution of jobs and data transfer, this would also maintain the lifecycle of cybershuttle agent and mft agents. This would help deploy any software and not limited to MFT agents.\n\nThe proposed solution is to automate the process of deploying and lifecycle management of the agents when a transfer job is submitted from an edge machine. This will help various researchers and people who needs to transfer data from a source to a destination without having much technical skills or time.\n\nThe deliverables are a piece of code to deploy the agent on various virtual machines, a piece of code to maintain the agent's lifecycle, an automated process for deployment and management, onboarding users and evaluating edge cases, and automated agent placement.\n\nThe benefits of the proposed solution are that it will make it easy and on the go solution for people even with less technical ability to use the vast speeds and advantages MFT offers. It will save time and effort for researchers and people who need to transfer data from a source to destination. It will make the MFT more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of people.

          "description": "Sage incorporates state-of-the-art libraries for exact linear algebra computations, such as matrix multiplication, reduced echelon form, linear system solving, when the coefficients are in an exact domain such as the integers or finite fields. However, several aspects make the integration of these libraries not yet fully satisfactory. For example, working over a prime field with a prime below about 20 bits, the mere creation of a zero matrix in SageMath takes roughly as long as the call of the underlying fast reduced echelon form procedure (performed by LinBox / FFLAS-FFPACK in this case). Still about FFLAS-FFPACK: several available tools in this library are not offered through the Sage interface, constraining the user experience; for example, some pivoting strategies are not available, despite their usefulness in some situations e.g. when one is interested in the preservation of some rank profile properties. Finally, the integration of linear algebra implementations from Flint has been initiated, with a good amount of work already done, but is not fully finalized and has not been merged into Sage. This project aims to make this kind of enhancements, which would lead to more efficient and more versatile finite field linear algebra operations in Sage.",

FFmpeg is the backbone to many open source\nmultimedia technologies, so a high-performance VVC decoder in FFmpeg will\nallow many other projects to process VVC-encoded video without the baggage\nof closed-source decoders. \n\nWhile modern compilers like Clang and GCC can employ tons of optimization\ntechniques to speed up a compiled program, compilers are still not capible\nof generating high-performance code for DSP and video processing workloads.\nModern compilers also struggle with the SIMD extensions introduced by CPU\nmanufacturers, such as the AVX2 extensions released by Intel in 2014. These\nSIMD extensions massively improve performance in DSP and video processing workloads, and FFmpeg's HEVC decoder already employs AVX2 SIMD instructions to improve performance.\n\nGiven that previous work into writing HEVC decoding filters in x86_64\nassembly with SIMD instructed yielded tangible performance improvements, this\nproposal aims to implement the VVC deblocking filter in x86_64 assembly\nto improve the ffvvc decoder's performance on x86_64 processors.",

In August, to improve the user experience of the \"You Draw It\" tool, I will add tool tips to the shiny applet that will explain tasks and help educate users on using the tool.

          "description": "The project aims to add new algorithms for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of polynomials in the sparse representation in order to improve the speed of many parts of sympy such as matrices, solvers, integration, and simplification functions. Currently, the slow speed of polynomial GCD impacts many operations in SymPy, leading to heavy performance penalties and avoiding the use of domain elements in some algorithms. By improving the speed of polynomial GCD algorithms, many parts of SymPy could become faster, and the use of GCD could become more widespread. This project could significantly enhance the overall performance and usability of SymPy.",

However, it has several flaws, including sluggish performance and being overly interconnected with the core of SymPy. As a result of its flaws, a new assumption system, the \"new assumptions,\" was proposed about a decade ago. Since then, the community has made slow but incremental progress in transitioning to and improving this new system. One of the main reasons for this change is that the old assumption system doesn't allow for relation assumptions to be expressed. While the new assumption system does support relational assumptions, the current implementation is very limited. My project aims to address this limitation by enabling the new assumption system to make inferences based on equalities and inequalities, such as \"if x > 0, then x must be positive.\"",

The first is to use packet filter (pf) for macOS, initially trying to swallow all traffic coming from the same machine that is launching packet filter itself. The second step in this approach will be to use some gimmick to figure out which packets are actually coming from mitmproxy and filter them out to avoid loops, a possible solution for this could be to use nettop, launching it as a command directly from rust, the solution is not definitive and possible alternatives should be explored to understand the privilege issue as well.\n2. A second approach is to use NEAppProxyProvider: an Apple proprietary framework that extends the functionality of the iOS and MacOS network stack. With NEAPP we can implement custom rules for filtering, routing, and modifying network traffic based on a variety of criteria, such as the app, the network protocol, the destination address, or the user identity. As it is a proprietary framework, we need to develop in Swift or objective-C and then transmit the information to the main mitmproxy stack.\n\nHow other proxies or VPN actually work:\n- WireGuard: wireguard has a apple version written in Swift, the adopted approach is the second one, it uses Apple Network Interfaces [ source ]\n- Squid: the same problem is  currently unsolved\n- TinyProxy: it uses  POSIX and no https transparent proxy",

Functions can be made more performant by reusing variables, using default function arguments, and caching repeated values. Reducing conditional checks, using switch statements, and avoiding redundant calculations can also improve performance. Using squared distance, subarray method, and reducing branching can also help optimize the library. CodeQL workflow can be added for security purposes.",

Since it does not require gradients, it can efficiently optimize hyper parameters for a Deep neural network or even electronic structure methods without derivatives. The project involves using Bayesian Optimization with an active learning approach to optimize conformers. The major work involves finding the right set of kernels for the Gaussian Process model for different types of molecular variables like Vibrational energy, bond lengths etc. and tuning them. We also an active learning approach to help the algorithm converge towards the solution much more quickly. Finally, we benchmark and compare the performance of our optimizer against other conformer optimization methods in use, like BFGS and gradient-based optimization algorithms.\n\nThis project has the potential to significantly improve the optimization capabilities of researchers in several fields by reducing the cost of optimization and improving optimization performance. The ALBGO algorithm will be a valuable addition to the optimization landscape, and its PyTorch-based implementation will make it easily accessible to a wide range of users including non-chemists.",

          "description": "I am writing to express my interest in contributing to GitLab's Pajamas Migration project as part of the Google Summer of Code program. As a computer science student at South Asia University, I am eager to gain more experience in the open-source community, and I believe that contributing to Pajamas Migration would be an excellent opportunity to do so. In Pajama Migration We have to ensure that all of the frontend components we use are GitLab-UI components, there are still some pages that are not using the right components.\nI am already Involved with Gitlab through MLH Fellowship and am working with the Foundation Team under the mentorship of our maintainer (James Rushford). James was a really great leader and mentor.\n\nI have worked on the following issue so far 112392, and 115432, and right now I am working on Pajamas Migration with our maintainer(James) on issues #395782 and #396775.\nmy Deliverables will include~ \n                           : Complete  Pajamas migrations.\n \t\t\t   : Build out the design system.\n                           : improve user experience\nMy plan~\n         May 4 - May 30: read project-related documents and codes, and get started quickly.\n         May 30 - July 5:  reasonably divide the work with another contributor, and record the corresponding documents at the same time.\n\tjuly 5 - august 21: will continue work on our plans and will try to complete our mission and also will get feedback from the mentor. \n\nmy previous experience at MLH with Gitlab was incredible. I gained valuable technical and soft skills, and I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects with experienced developers. Working with Gitlab helped me gain a better understanding of DevOps.So, I am looking forward work with GitLab again.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing back from you and learning more about how I can get involved in this project in your way. Maybe by giving more details? Knowing the Scope. Thank you for considering my application.",

          "description": "My project goal was to add DICOM file support to caMicroscope, a Whole Slide Image viewer. The viewer backend (OpenSlide) didn't support DICOM, so we needed a second backend. Surprisingly, before the coding period started, OpenSlide did get DICOM file support and this gave me the opportunity to tackle the bigger challenge of integrating BioFormats into caMicroscope. This would be extraordinary, as BioFormats is a Java library with no C wrappers available online.\n\nI started by refactoring caMicroscope code to use a single base Dockerfile which compiled OpenSlide. Then I made a Java wrapper and prepared its corresponding C caller. For this, I had chosen GraalVM C API, but once I found out about its level of performance and its requirement to achieve high code covergage first (for metadata collection), I rewrote it for Java JNI. To make it available to the two derivatives of our base image, I refactored this to be a separate project. We also needed to make this available to our Python image metadata server, so I wrote a wrapper in Python using cffi.",

The motive of this project proposal is to handle the summarization task (mostly Abstractive + Extractive hybrid approach) through the language model’s (foundation model) lens. This project aims to cover everything from data collection, EDA, experimenting with different language models to developing production-scale system that can take GitHub repo as reference and provide summary. One of the challenges that is novel is to use smaller sized models to achieve great performance in summarization.\n\nSCoRe Lab has been into developing solutions in the space of making user life easier with products such as D4D, Bassa, Track Pal, and others.

Support for these constructs is confusing to programmers and potentially affects GCC's ability to implement features from future C standards. But newer versions of compilers (for example Clang 16, expected March 2023) are planning on becoming significantly stricter with the C code they will accept or reject. This is a huge problem for the general Linux ecosystem.\n\nEven worse is that some of these failures are silent and lead to incorrect behaviour at runtime. Extra care must be taken to detect this and we must prioritize these cases because they're the most harmful. \n\nAlso, in the coming years with C2x (likely C23), additional changes like removing certain depreciated prototypes will be made.\n\nAll of these changes will affect Gentoo packages in the following ways:\nLots of packages fail to build with these settings\nSometimes packages build successfully but their ./configure scripts have mis-detected features or otherwise made the wrong conclusion about the system because they expect a test to succeed when it now fails.",

          "description": "As the demand for High-Performance Computing (HPC) continues to grow, there is a need for open-source solutions that can deliver the performance required by modern applications. Different open-source architecture frameworks have been developed by the community, like OpenPiton, however, all of them present performance limitations that impact their ability to execute computationally-intensive tasks. \n\nOpenPiton is an open-source framework for designing many-core processors. Although OpenPiton was originally developed for SPARC v9 architectures, currently it is also compatible with different core architectures (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9). In this project, we will focus on improving the performance of the integration of CVA6/Ariane into OpenPiton (OpenPiton+Ariane).\n\nThe architecture of OpenPiton consists of one chipset and one or more tiles. The chipset houses modules used to communicate the tiles with the peripherals, such as the UART. The tile is used to build the mesh for many-core designs. In these designs, the tiles are interconnected by three NoC routers to generate the mesh. Each tile comprises the three NoC routers, the Ariane core, and the cache hierarchy, which consists of Ariane’s private L1 data and instruction caches, a private L1.5 cache and a shared distributed L2 cache. \n\nDespite the fact that OpenPiton offers many advantages, it presents performance limitations that restrict its adoption in the HPC field. In this project, we will improve the performance of OpenPiton by replacing the L1 data cache of Ariane with the High-Performance, Multi-Requester, Out-of-Order, L1 data cache (HPDcache). In addition, other features such as the amount of L1.5 cache miss status holding registers (MSHRs) or the L1.5 cache associativity can also be improved in order to approach OpenPiton even closer to the HPC field.",

In terms of the project, the goal is to work in scripts to draw devices like LDNMOS, LDPMOS, bipolar transistors, photodiodes, Avalanche Diode, etc as well as fixing a few devices that are known to draw incorrectly for some parameter values.as far as working on this project is concerned as per my own rough timeline following is the methodology i would use while working on the project : The magic VLSI tool uses TCL scripts for the parameterized design layouts so we should start by going through some of the scripts to get a better understanding of what we are working with then we will be going through each of the mentioned devices and study its CMOS design and draw it on the magic tool using the magic command line TCL scripts, we will also be looking at the pre-existing devices to check if we were getting the required drawings of them or not if the drawings are not as required then we will be making changes to those scripts as well, in the meantime, we will be looking for improvements we could make on the user inference of magic tool too. \nto get a better understanding of how I would work on this project please go through the proposal I have attached below. \nthankyou soo much for your time, \nlooking forward to working with you soon.",

Unfortunately, allocating superpages can often fail due to a high rate of external fragmentation in physical memory.

Aside from explicit invocation, a background daemon would monitor\nthe relevant fragmentation metric and trigger the memory compaction mechanism should the value drop below a certain threshold.\nThe last goal will introduce a passive anti-fragmentation mechanism for the demand paging mechanism.

Starting with GSoC 2022 and continuing over the last year several potential solutions have been developed and shared with the community via patches and RFCs. This has helped to build further understanding of both front-end and internal LLVM limitations. Based on the latest RFC two possible semantic solutions have been identified that allow loads to migrate to poison by default and provide backward compatibility with the current load undef semantics. This is accomplished by either freezing all bits regardless of initialization state or byte-level freezing based on initialization state. By implementing both solutions real-world performance metrics and maintenance impact can be evaluated by the LLVM community.

This has many advantages but can make it difficult to predict which code path is executed when the compiler is invoked with a certain test input, especially for edge cases where error handling is involved. The goal of this project is to help developers create good test coverage for their patch and enable reviewers to verify that they have done so. To accomplish this we would like to introduce a tool that can be fed a patch as input, add coverage instrumentation for the affected source files, runs Lit tests, and records which test cases cause each counter to be executed. For each counter we can then report the number of test cases executing the counter, but perhaps more importantly we can also report the number of test cases executing the counter that are also changed in some way by the patch, since a modified line that results in the same test results isn’t properly tested, unless it’s intended to be a non-functional change.",

In general hot functions can only be identified at runtime (different inputs will cause different functions to become hot), so the aim of the reoptimization project is to build infrastructure to (1) detect hot functions at runtime and (2) compile them a second time at a higher optimization level, hence the name \"re-optimization\".\n\nThere are many possible approaches to both parts of this problem. E.g. hot functions could be identified by sampling, or using existing profiling infrastructure, or by implementing custom instrumentation. Reoptimization could be applied to whole functions, or outlining could be used to enable optimization of portions of functions. Re-entry into the JIT infrastructure from JIT’d code might be implemented on top of existing lazy compilation, or via a custom path.\n\nWhatever design is adopted, the goal is that the infrastructure should be generic so that it can be used by other LLVM API clients, and should support out-of-process JIT-compilation (so some of the solution will be implemented in the ORC runtime).",

Originally started in 2022 as a part of a GSoC project, this tool determines the health score of a plugin. Probes are the heart of the tool. To extend the work started last year, I propose adding new probes to make the tool more valuable and feature-complete. \n\nProject Description\n\nJenkins is an almost two-decade-old open-source project with over 1000 repositories. Plugins bridge the gap between Jenkins and different environments. \nA project as mature and large-scale as Jenkins requires active involvement from active maintainers. \n\nIn general, probes serve two purposes within the context of this toolset: \nTo collect the data to compute the score of the plugin systematically. Based on the computed score, the health of the plugin can be determined.\nBased on the score future contributors, maintainers, and adopters decide which plugin(s) they want to invest their time in. \n\n\nProject Deliverables\n\nDesigning of the probes\nIdentify the key features and functionality of the plugins.\nDefine the metrics that would contribute to the Plugin Health Score.\nThe more probe criteria the plugin meets, the higher the health score of the plugin.\n\nDeciding the probe’s interaction with other probes\n\nDetermining how the probe would contribute to the score.\n\nAdding unit test cases for each probe and scoring implementation. If time permits, I will add integration test cases too.\n\nThe final delivery would be 10 new probes to the Plugin Health Scoring System. \nThese probes will contribute to calculating the overall health of a plugin.\nBy the time the project ends, the tool will approximately have 24 probes in all (10 new + 14 existing probes)\n\nProposed Implementation Plan \n\n- Build each probe, implement it, score it and write its test cases. \n\n- Define interaction of probes with each other.\n\n- Define execution order of each probe.\n\nStretch Goals\n\n- Adding metrics probe\n- Writing integration test cases",

          "description": "Ruby uses garbage collection (GC) to automatically reclaim memory that was allocated by a program, but no longer used. Consequently, users do not have to manually manage memory, and can more easily avoid memory management issues such as memory leak. However, the program being executed must be stopped for the GC to run. Therefore the efficiency of the GC algorithm will affect the performance of the program.\n\nThe project’s goal is to reduce the cost of GC when there are multiple fibers. Fibers are a memory efficient way to implement cooperative concurrency. Programmers control scheduling of the fiber instead of the operating system, making it possible to better allocate CPU resources. Ruby 3.0, released in 2020, added a Fiber Scheduler, which enables asynchronous behaviour in programs. Ruby’s GC scans through a program’s memory at various points during its execution, identifies which objects are no longer used, and removes them using an incremental tri-color mark and sweep algorithm and generational garbage collection. Improving the GC cost when there are many fibers will enhance the performance of Ruby programs, particularly asynchronous Ruby programs making use of fibers.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Reproducible test that triggers GC for fibers\n2. Identification of GC bottlenecks for fibers\n3. Reduction of bottlenecks compared to benchmark test through improvements to GC\n4.

          "description": "For years, the government has struggled to provide helpful information for residents in need. Sometimes the resources are not readily accessible, or the channel of communication is simply missing. Many people have questions about government policies but don’t know where to ask or never bother to read through official documents; instead, they end up getting incomplete or misleading information from the web. \nThese issues call for a system that handles queries on a large scale with high efficiency and consistency - this is where large language models (LLM) come into the picture. With the help of exciting tools like LlamaIndex, we are now able to extend the knowledge base of LLMs like ChatGPT to more specific domains and tailor the model’s responses to be more relevant to the residents’ needs. \n\nThis project will extend ChatGPT’s knowledge base with specific government data (such as pdfs of housing policies) and provide a frontend interface for user to interact with a ChatGPT-style chatbot. In addition to the ability to chat and ask questions, users will also be given the power to evaluate responses of the chatbot by giving a thumb up/thumb down to the response.",

The Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics is focused on creating innovative and equitable services for the residents of Boston. The proposed dashboard will help City departments monitor their infrastructure investments, analyze and visualize trends over time, and identify any disparities in the distribution of these investments. The dashboard will be built using frequently updated open data and will include a map-based view of infrastructure investments and various charts to spot trends. \n\nThe project will be built using the latest technology in GIS and web mapping platforms. \nThe proposed dashboard will be a valuable tool for City departments in measuring and improving equity in their infrastructure investments. The project has the potential to improve the quality of life for residents of Boston by identifying disparities in the distribution of investments and helping City departments to address these disparities.
