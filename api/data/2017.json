The program structure is divided into three main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Communication software</li>\n<li>Graphical user interface (GUI)</li>\n<li>Controller for interaction between communication software and graphical user interface</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Due to the fact that the functionality of every experiment should be checked before lift-off, a communication software for up- und downlink is required. Based on the input of the user in a configuration file, the GUI and partially also the controllers can be written automatically. In this matter, USOC generates appropriate functionalities within the controllers for individual GUI contents, which can then be adapted manually. Changes in the configuration file are detected, localized and the corresponding GUI structures and controller functionalities are regenerated. If these are manually written functionalities, they are recognized and not overwritten. USOC also brings pre-coded functions, such as communication via serial ports and/or the Iridium satellite network, as well as a three-dimensional visualization of GNSS data.</p>\n",

To break this barrier, a REST API can be implemented which will be used by a web interface to make use of VXQuery effectively. Therefore, adding a REST API will add more value to VXQuery and will help VXQuery to reach more users in the future.

However, noVNC is still limited by the fact that JavaScript cannot make plain TCP connections. noVNC uses WebSockets to connect to the server. noVNC includes a generic WebSockets to TCP bridge ( WebSockify ) that you can run on the server or the client. Using noVNC would be better than the current customized VNC in ACS. However, this project aims at adding noVNC support along with the current VNC feature. They will communicate to the VM via different ports.</p>\n",

The proposed zookeeper module will minimize the manual configuration required when configuring OODT components. That is, this module will make use of the inherited configuration at component level. For example consider the file manager. Almost all the configurations of file manager instances are identical. Therefore, new file managers which are coming up later will inherit the configuration of the initial file managers and will almost remove the manual configuration required when adding new nodes to the cluster.</p>\n",

Ardupilot rover version (APMRover2) is well behind Arduplane and ArduCopter in capabilities as they attract more attention from developers.  One obvious example is that Rover has only a very basic avoidance system (turn 45° on obstacle). It is also missing some autonomous features (on spot turn etc.), and more significantly is missing a proper motor configuration abstraction layer. While ArduCopter is capable of being configured in 4,6,8 motors copter with brushed (PWM) or brushless motor (RC PWM), the rover version is still limited to two modes: rover with propulsion and a steering servo (normal mode) and tank mode (skid steering mode), with only support on brushless motor.\nMy proposal to this GSOC is split in two parts. Firstly, reduce the gap between the APMRover2 and the other vehicles to provide a good generic UGV platform capable of multiple configurations, with advance feature such as avoidance.  Secondly,  provide a good set of tutorials on the usage of ROS and ardupilot either for single unit control or on simulated unit on Gazebo simulator!</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The nature of distributed systems and their fault model is chaotic: replicas can fail temporarily or just stop working, and the complexity of adding defensive code against all possible scenarios is unrealistic if complex applications are to be designed. Despite several techniques that try to mitigate this issue (e.g. RPC), a more opaque abstraction layer is needed in order to avoid long implementation times as well as incorrect behaviour driven from faulty or careless code. I believe that providing a programming-language-level abstraction layer is an effective approach to significantly reduce the amount of time focused on how systems can fail, rather than how they should work. Such an approach should mainly consist in supplying systems programmers with basic functionalities in the following areas: node distribution, data replication and partition tolerance.\nBeing in an early adoption stage, Lasp needs applications that can serve as proof of concept in order to increase awareness of its capabilities as well as user adoption. This proposal is about the implementation of a real world application based on previous work published recently at PaPoC'17 - an EuroSys workshop.</p>\n",

So, the proposal will not only focus on the port of Tkinter to Toga, but on mapping the necessary widgets for a real application using Toga framework. In addition of the advantages of using Toga instead of Tkinter as I highlighted, this is a opportunity to improve error handling and make better use of features that Toga has but Tkinter does not.

          "description": "<p>While retrieving articles with simple boolean queries will suffer from a list of problems in general, several machine learning approaches can be applied to allow better performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In particular, instead of naively focusing on the existence of the topic in the article, techniques with machine learning can broaden the search range by including more relevant secondary keywords in addition to the various variation of the given topic. Meanwhile, methods (such as SVM, nearest neighbor) can also be employed to prune the fetched articles to filter out those are irrelevant to our topic despite containing the exact words on the topic. Furthermore, due to the fact that articles may use different choices of words over time, time series analysis needs to be applied to keep track of the evolution of one topic during a certain period of time. In this project, I plan to design and implement a proof of concept unsupervised machine learning approach to retrieve articles and prune the results, with the assistance of mathematical models.</p>\n",

Encrypting communications between the client and the server using SSL is not enough to protect users privacy, since data can be read in plaintext in the server, which is not trustworthy.</p>\n<p>It is trickier to perform E2EE into SwellRT documents than it is to perform it into simple chat messages. SwellRT use operational transformations (OTs) to coordinate the insertion and deletion of characters in its documents, so instead of encrypting the entire document, we need to encrypt each operation and still guarantee that the server has enough information to coordinate the document editioning. Fortunately, it is a field that has been researched for many years and we have some studies that have successfully implemented E2EE in Google Docs. We can take their insights to encrypt SwellRT OTs.</p>\n<p>The project has two parts. First, we need to encrypt and decrypt successfully SwellRT OTs, using a symmetric key. Then, we need to communicate those symmetric keys among users, and here is where we need public key cryptography.</p>\n",

Gatekeeper is an open source defence against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To protect server resources from an attack, it services requests based on priority: the higher its priority, the closer to the exit of the egress queue its placed. Additionally, it also limits the requests’ maximum link bandwidth occupancy to 5%. Such countermeasures are implemented through the priority queue data structure which holds all requests in a single priority queue dropping low-priority requests when resources are low. This functionality allows us to allocate as many resources as possible to high-priority requests while servicing low-priority requests only when resources are idle. The successful implementation of this project will essentially enable a regular Linux router to help isolate and protect legitimate traffic during DoS attacks by employing Gatekeeper’s priority queue as a kernel module, enabled by its userspace component in Linux's tc(8) utility.</p>\n",

Currently, the user has to create a sketch for the rebar profile and define the required set of constraints. This becomes very time-consuming task even for an expert level user when he/she has a building model with several structural objects. This project is aimed at easing up the process of rebaring in FreeCAD. In this project, list of rebars will be provided to user in the form of dropdown. On selecting a rebar from dropdown, a dialog box will popout with input fields where can provide data related to selected rebar. The entire project will be delivered as a FreeCAD addon. The input fields in the dialog box are further categorised and presented in the form of tabs. User can easily switch to any tab to see contained input fields, thus enriching the experience by keeping the natural flow of user. With successful completion of this project, FreeCAD user will have an easy and professional way to create rebars for their projects with less efforts in less time.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>A major need in cancer research is the development of non-invasive cancer detection and monitoring methods. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is DNA that has escaped from tumor cells and is free-floating in the bloodstream, meaning that genetic information about the developing tumor can be obtained without the need to invasively extract tumor tissue. cBioPortal wants to display the insights obtained from these “liquid biopsies” onto their existing Patient View page. I propose to create a global view of ctDNA information by modifying their existing Genomic Overview to display allele frequencies, allowing users to identify at a glance mutated genes of interest. Mutated genes can be tracked by clicking on the gene, which would display a plot of the gene’s mutation concentration over time. A heatmap of selected genes can also be generated to monitor tumor heterogeneity over time. Another feature could consist of plots to track whether a mutated gene produces a differential time to relapse or survival time compared to the unaltered gene. By visualizing ctDNA results on the cBioPortal interface, I can participate in adding an exciting new clinician tool for personalized cancer genomics.</p>\n",

It has currently integrated a few resources, including OncoKB, MyCancerGenome, and CancerHotspot.org in the annotation column in the mutation table. In addition to this, it would be useful to link to clinical trials too for each mutation.\nClinical trials are a key research tool for advancing medical knowledge and patient care. They are an important step in discovering new treatments for cancers and other diseases as well as new ways to detect, diagnose, and reduce the risk of disease. Therefore I propose to link clinical trials for cancer studies in CBioPortal which will improve the ability to analyze and interpret the genomic data for various kinds of mutations.

Since calculating the checksum of an entire image would be too slow and inefficient, I came up with the pretty trivial solution to use a rolling hash checksum algorithm.</p>\n<p>Rolling hash algorithms reduce computational complexity (i.e. save time and memory) at the price of weaker hashing (i.e. larger risk of collisions). They split the input into chunks, and calculate the hash of each chunk using a simple (i.e. fast) hashing algorithm. What is important to note here is that the hash for the whole string is calculated incrementally, beginning from zero (or some known constant value), and for each chunk the checksum of the string including that chunk is calculated only using the old checksum (of the string without the new chunk) and the difference between the last chunk and the current one.</p>\n<p>Some useful rolling hash algorithms that could be employed are Fletcher’s checksum algorithms or the Adler-32 checksum.</p>\n",

All Monte Carlo (MC) simulations depend vitally on Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) used to sample many distributions.\nEach LHC experiments generates 5-10 Billion sampled physics events a year using around 10^18 sampled values from PRNGs. PRNGs take 1-5% of CPU time. PRNGs used must possess very large periods, fast execution, the ability to create a large number of streams, and very good correlation properties between streams and sampled values. It must be possible to reproduce a simulated event any time, for reexamination or debugging.\nThe transition from event-level parallelism in Geant4 to dynamical multithreading in GeantV requires associating the random generator states not with the threads but with the tracks, which are shuffled between \"baskets\" based on their type and energy. Maintaining reproducibility after such transition requires a drastic change in the way the random generators are used. We suggest solutions based on Scalable Pseudo Random Number Generators and on pedigrees introduced in CilkPlus, which are first tested in Geant4.</p>\n",

After the rapid growth in the amount of the annotated data and the recent improvements in the strengths of graphics processor units, the research on convolutional neural networks has been emerged swiftly and achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks. GPUs are much more effective in utilizing parallelism and pipelining than general purpose CPUs, as they are designed for high performance rendering where repeated operations are common.

In the beginning, I will remove all tests from the pipeline that do not pass for Python 3 and take this pared–down code base as a starting point, porting parts of the code and putting the respective unit tests back in as I go along. Missing unit tests must be added before moving on. Since porting Python 2 code to Python 3 code is a standard problem for the Python community, there are many different tools available that can help in this regard.

Current Sphinx dictionaries only support limited words and languages, which is difficult to meet the needs of applications, so expanding dictionaries in Sphinx is an urgent need. It's critical to reuse existing pronunciation dictionaries to improve system performance, support new words appeared recently and more languages. A valuable pronunciation source is Wiktionary, which is a multilingual, web-based project to create a free content dictionary of all words in all languages. Although Wiktionary contains pronunciations for many words and multiple languages in a standard format like IPA, it’s not easy to parse those pronunciations from sources in different page formats and convert phonemes in different languages to one common format like CMUBET which can be used by Sphinx. This project will solve those problems and form at least 10 pronunciation dictionaries which will be tested on several ASR benchmarks for Sphinx.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>ROS has support for pocketsphinx, but it is very initial stage. So, this project aims to update the ROS package for pocketsphinx with a full-scale support for the recent features and updates. Also, the current package makes use of many external dependencies for its proper functioning. This leads to a lot of complexities in the installation process and in maintaining the codebase. So, another motivation for this project is to get rid of as many of the external dependencies as possible and maintain a proper documentation for the new package. The existing codebase does not have a proper wiki or documentation, neither for the developers, nor for the end-users. And ROS is all about flexible usability. So, this project would also strive to provide a concise, clear and up-to-date documentation of the entire package.</p>\n",

The camera follows the player object by calculating the difference in the X values and each frame smoothly matching the camera’s X value to the player object.</p>\n<p>I’d like to really show off what the engine can do graphically.

The second part is a little scattered, including making a RPM package for Plinth and setting up a repo for it in <a href=\"https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Copr</a>, testing inside a Virtual Machine, and modifying some configuration files and the documents for users to fit the changes of Plinth during this project, at the same time, a new wiki page for Plinth in Fedora is needed.</p>\n",

High-quality audio combined with a fully open license should be valued by the open source community as an alternative to codecs that require a patent license for encoding or payments in order to legally stream.</p>\n<p>However, FFmpeg’s native vorbis encoder is currently labeled as experimental or broken due to its relatively poor performance and audio quality in comparison to competing audio codecs. It serves only to output a valid bitstream, with little concern about quality. This project aims to improve the general performance of the encoder, bringing it closer to a viable status. This will be done by integrating features of the existing AAC psychoacoustic model system within the native Vorbis encoder and adapting the FFmpeg Vorbis decoder to utilize that new information. Finally, additional documentation and test coverage will be added to enable long-term development in this area.</p>\n",

To emulate the ancient I/O, various “I/O flavours” will be designed to interface with the FPGA board, via a standardised communication protocol. Users can choose, extend and even add new I/O flavours. An assembler utility will be built in Python, which users can utilise to debug and build their code for EDSAC, which can be then loaded onto the FPGA for execution.</p>\n",

These tests need to be first installed individually before they can be used for testing. This proves problematic in cases when direct testing of some newly installed or updated utility/library has to be performed. It makes testing changes to libraries and utilities difficult as one would like to perform tests (e.g. to ensure a proper build environment) before proceeding for installation.<br>\nThis project aims to develop a new test infrastructure and automation tool along with basic tests to verify if all the base utilities in FreeBSD are linked properly. The testing framework will ease the process of writing test cases which will be run in a completely automated and developer friendly manner without need for any prior installation.

HoloLens uses the real-world as a canvas on which to overlay virtual elements. \nThe prospective application will utilise the genetic data held by Ensembl, and bring genes and genomes to life by creating 3-D ‘holograms’ of them which viewers can interact with using natural gestures, voice commands, and eye movements. \nDepending on the success of the resulting application, there is scope to move the application to the Improbable Spatial OS platform (<a href=\"https://improbable.io/\" target=\"_blank\">https://improbable.io/</a>), which can be integrated with applications built with Unity. (Improbable is partnered with Google Cloud Platform to deliver their services). This platform allows developers to build simulations of virtual worlds in which concurrent players can interact.

The ultimate goal of this project is to make use of more of what Tracker provides so more search criteria will be available in order for the search results to provide more accurate results for it’s users. Besides this, other goals of this project are to fix the most important search bugs, work on performance, it’s debuggability and testing.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The goal of this proposal is to implement a Plugin System in Pitivi and a set of at least three plugins: the “Developer Console”, the “Timeline Markers” and “Automatic Transitions”. The first one is a tool for Pitivi developers and Pitivi’s plugins developers that will allow them to do quick experiments at runtime by having access to all the internal objects of Pitivi saving time to them. The second plugin gives the user a sense of time, by drawing vertical lines each ten seconds (or other period of time). For example, it will be useful when the user zooms in and wants to move along the timeline, because Pitivi will display guidelines. Finally, the third one is a plugin that avoid the tedious process of dragging video (or image) clips over other video (or image) clips in order to create a transition when there are a very large set of this clips. This plugin will save time to users who just want to import a set of images (of last vacation trip for example) to create a video as fast as possible.</p>\n",

Implementation of Todoist will require a OAuth2 authentication and implementation of Todoist Provider that manages loading/editing tasks/ task lists and saving changes to Todoist Server. We would use GOA's already implemented OAuth2 authentication, by adding a Todoist Provider in GOA which will manage users login and store the access tokens. The Todoist plugin inside To DO will make use of the todoist v7 API to make sync calls for process like loading tasks,lists or updating tasks etc. Todoist server responds to every request with a JSON response. The Todoist provider would check the JSON response for error and if correct process it to retrieve requested data.\nAt the end of the project we will have a working Todoist plugin which will be a nice addition to To Do. Beside this, the project will take care of some feature implementations currently being used in Todoist and also general bug-fixing if time permits.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>During last decades Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have increasingly become a fundamental tool for high accuracy positioning purposes. For this reason, it is crucial to guarantee a certain high quality of service (QoS). This QoS may be degraded by the presence of spurious undesirable signals coming from jammers that could degrade partially (or totally) the bandwidth of the desired GNSS signal.\nBasically, two kinds of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) can disturb a GNSS signal. Each one has its own characteristic spectral feature and a classification based on that is described as following:\n•    Continuous wave interferences (CWI): a perturbation of a relative small part of the spectrum and can be mitigated by means of a notch filter.\n•    Short pulsed interferences: with an instantaneous bandwidth that usually covers the entire GNSS band and can be partially removed by means of a blanking filter. \nTwo interference detection and mitigation algorithms will be evaluated in order to implement a new Signal conditioner block into GNSS-SDR.

However, bottleneck exists in terms of how much data can be transferred between hard disk and memory for computation  [1]. As research increasingly relies on processing huge volumes of data, this issue demands attention. One strategy which addresses this is memory compression of data in memory (DRAM). Algorithms that are effective do a good job of decompressing exactly as much of the data as are needed for the calculations, so that they still minimize the memory footprint of the program without significant speed drops.</p>\n<p>This proposal exists to address this bottleneck within the Neuromapp program created by members of the Blue Brain Project team. The project proposed is split into research and implementation of in-memory compression along the lines of compression library selection, interface algorithm development, and block data structure design. The resulting compression mini-app is intended to relieve this bottleneck, and provide accelerated calculation capacity for the suite of associated mini-apps that come with Neuromapp.</p>\n",

However, the limitation of GeNN is that it can only support running on a single GPU or a single shared-memory machine. This proposal is to plan for expanding GeNN to multiple machine clusters. MPI is common message passing interface and infrastructure to communicate across multiple hosts and it is natural to expand GeNN with MPI interface to achieve parallel execution on multiple hosts. The key point of this project is to balance GeNN computation simulations across MPI hierarchy between hosts and block/thread on individual GPU. Furthermore, This proposal shows potential tuning directions basing on MPI-CUDA hierarchy. To bridge the gap between the destination and implementation, this proposal also describes  feasible stages for the MPI-GeNN project and narrates the candidate’s motivation, background and progressive approach.

One of the core problems in this domain is to rapidly perform detailed single-neuron calculations. These are typically the bottleneck in detailed multiscale and network models.\nThe central computation is solution of a large, almost tridiagonal matrix representing compartments in a neuron. Individual entries in this matrix require an inner loop to compute current contributions to the compartment. It is a particularly interesting problem to optimize GPU computations for these neuron calculations, since there is a tradeoff between memory transfers and speed of individual GPU cores. \nOptimizing the GPU code will increase the speedup, when the no of computations are very large,  then even a small amount of speedup is very beneficial as it saves a lot of time, so optimizing the GPU code is important.</p>\n",

It has already developed good logical structures for sending of push notifications using JMS. Moreover,  its \"sender\" module is mainly constructed of different message queues and their producers and consumers. On the other hand, the server DB is currently based on MySQL/PostgreSQL and each data entry lies in one DB scheme.\n   We need the process for sending of push notifications and the evaluation of message metrics to be as fast as possible and as scalable as possible. Therefore, with an increase of our data problems can be caused by slow writes/reads to DB and not scalable enough message queue usage.\n    The idea of the project is to try to overcome these obstacles and rebuild some modules of the system in the way that they perform well even if the data volume they are operating over increases. For that two different approaches can be taken. To speed up the DB access a new distributed, scalable, big data store HBase can be integrated into the project.

An accuracy script will be written in Darknet to evaluate the accuracy of the created models, original YOLO (only RGB), extended YOLO (depth only) and YOLO-D (RGB + depth). The inclusion of depth should hopefully result in an increase in accuracy.</p>\n",

In addition, we will try to use Deep Reinforcement Learning methods to implement DQN agent as baseline and use a robot to learn how to navigate in an unknown map, using sensory data as input to the network, and generating velocity commands for the robot as the output of the network.\nAutonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance, can be used for autonomous driving in an unknown environment that we don't have any map from that. It is also useful for dynamic environments in which the map is constantly changing. This project could be used for autonomous exploring and mapping the environments, providing another solution replacing well-known SLAM algorithm.</p>\n",

These domains include sensors (for instance, cameras), actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent software. Details for the project:\nProject #5. Teaching Robotics: Translation of a Scratch program to ROS python components\nScratch is a free visual programming language used in children's education, to teach them basic programming. It is composed of graphical building blocks (instructions) that must be visually connected to build the program. The idea here is to take benefit of our experience translating from a graphical description of a program in visual HFSM into a JdeRobot-ROS component to do the same with a different visual language, Scratch. The goal is to explore the use of Scratch with robots, both simulated or real, that JdeRobot-ROS allows and simplifies. We will start with simulated robots in Gazebo, despite with real robots will be the same as they use the same interfaces.\nThis project expects to develop a new tool prototype that reads Scratch programs and translate them into ROS Python components.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The aim of this project is to enhance some portions of the application that implement the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). Specifically :</p>\n<h5>CONDSTORE</h5>\n<p>The Conditional Store extension, defined in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7162\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 7162</a>, adds an additional mod-sequence value to every message. This makes it possible to reference changes made to the mailbox made since a particular point in time, which is extremely useful for mobile clients that are not always connected to the internet. Adding support for the CONDSTORE extension will help to greatly reduce the time and data spent on resynchronization.</p>\n<h5>Search</h5>\n<p>K-9 Mail has a basic search feature that searches the local database as well as the remote server for messages. The project aims to add features that make it more modern, such as suggestions, nested search, filters and proper full-text search.</p>\n<h5>Miscellaneous improvements</h5>\n<p>Support for some additional IMAP operations will also be added :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the UID EXPUNGE command when available so that messages deleted by other clients are not expunged by accident.</li>\n<li>Switching  between and modifying namespaces.</li>\n<li>Moving messages across different IMAP accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n",

However, since the performance is not as expected, the algorithm needs to be improved. Another two face recognition algorithms named Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces are partially implemented in the face engine and the two algorithms will be finalized. One sufficient reason that recognition cannot work is that we don’t have any code for pose estimation and normalization. To improve face recognition, new face algorithm with pose estimation and normalization will be added. The algorithms will be selectable in GUI by users.

A casual user may not see it as a problem but for power users, sysadmins, developers this is a huge impedance. Many users get around this by starting the whole application as root. Running Qt/KDE GUI solves the issue but its a very dangerous solution. Dangerous because if not handled properly it can cause irreversible damage to the the system. To address this issue some KDE applications are disabling being executed as root. For example, the next versions of Dolphin and Kate will show an error message and exit when started with root privileges.</p>\n<p>Polkit is just the tool which can solve this problem.

          "description": "<p>The upgraded role of cubesats, fueled by technological advances in the aerospace industry, that lower launch costs, has opened access to space for a wider audience. \nSpace is a harsh environment for microelectronics. Radiation induced Single Event Upsets can trigger bit flips in memory that could have catastrophic consequences rendering a cubesat useless. Current state of fault tolerance is to either use Rad-Hard electronics that their cost makes it suitable only for high profile missions or the use of Commercial off-the-shelf electronics that offer little protection.</p>\n<p>My proposal is to modify the lowRISC SoC, employing the Core Lock Step fault tolerant technique in minion cores by integrating a CLS assist unit, in order to be suitable for use in a cubesat mission.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Memory access is one of the most important operation done in modern processors thus it plays an important role in implementation of trusted execution environment. Recent secure processors and trusted environment encrypt memory contents to protect those important memory operations. However, sometimes just encrypting data is not enough since there are intelligent attackers who can see where the memory access goes to and infer where the real important data lies in. Those important data includes the private data, key, or OS fingerprint and else. These kind of attacks lead to concept of “memory obliviousness” to secure memory address itself. ORAM refers to Oblivious memory which can leverage obliviousness using specialized data structures and obfuscate memory access so even an attacker see or probe the memory access itself, he never learns about where important data lies on or even where the memory requests are headed to. Initially proposed by Goldreich and Ostrovsky, ORAM obfuscates memory access using random permutation, shuffling and encryption of contents. In this proposal, I’ll implement ORAM interface to support obliviousness on RISC-V’s trusted execution environment.</p>\n",

Discoverability is currently another issue, Riot is a completely frontend application so spidering it is near-impossible, this can be solved through making a read-only server generated view for spiders to work on.

All components in app inventor are part of some screen or activity which means that if the screen is not visible or the screen is destroyed by the Android system, the components stop running. An example of this is the Pedometer component which stops running when the phone screen is off. Ideally, a pedometer app would want to keep running once started in the background until the user of the app explicitly stops it.

Each of the features/key-points are associated with some sort of key signatures (called descriptors of those key points). Many existing methods for detection/description of these features exists, each descriptor has certain properties that are suitable for certain vision applications. Some of the existing methods include SIFT, SURF, BRISK, FAST, ORB,AKAZE, LATCH, LSD/BLD (lines), etc. Some of the detectors already provide descriptors but some of them do not, so different combinations of descriptors can be used. In this project a GUI application is built which evaluates these descriptors/key-points.

Such an API can be used to consume an existing native library in your high-level code or add scripting support to a native codebase. The supported target languages at present are C# and C++/CLI. It can also be used as a library to parse native code into a syntax tree with a rich declaration and type information model.

The concept of Scenarios has been suggested in the past and would be very important in order to properly develop any notion of “static” worlds such as what would exist for Light &amp; Shadow. In addition, it would provide assistance to creation of exploration worlds such as the suggested Maze world.</p>\n<p>The implementation of scenarios can be thought of as basically creating a “game maker” style engine built into Terasology.</p>\n<p>As additional smaller, but very important goals attached to this idea, I intend to extend the currently existing tools for creation which mostly include BlockPicker and StructureTemplates both of these tools work well at what they do, but both are still limited for large creations as they require placing everything by hand. This is where the brush tool I propose can come in handy. The brush tool is designed to allow for “brush-strokes” being made using blocks to quickly create large structures and terraforming. These brush tools would allow for the following interactions.</p>\n",

PDF.js current uses xhr for networking to fetch data, but it is inefficient in terms of memory as it has to buffer all the response. As xhr is an ever growing buffer, it stores all the data in its internal buffer, this uses lots of memory. Using Streams API, we can use the response incrementally and pass it for parsing and rendering as soon as it is received, hence there is no need to buffer the whole response. For rendering purpose, PDF.js makes chunks of data by parsing pdf commands in worker thread. After chunking the whole data, it is passed to the main thread for painting. Buffering the entire data in the worker thread uses a huge amount memory, and main thread also has to wait for the entire data to be parsed. This creates inefficiency in terms of memory and speed. Using Streams API, we can send the chunks from worker thread to main thread as soon as they are created, reducing the memory usage and increases speed. Since Streams API is a new technology, using it in PDF.js will test Firefox's implementation.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Systems biology researchers study the network of molecular interactions within a biological system and publish the deduced models in a diagram format. Many XML variants were developed to represent diagrams, including SBML and SBGN. However, SBML can represent much more complex models than SBGN. For example, the SBML qual extension package can mechanistically describe events in its models, such as the relationship that A activates C, B activates C, but A and B cannot activate C at the same time. The SBGN Activity Flow language can describe a similar relationship, but the relationship is represented visually only, and therefore is not stored in its model. The incompatibilities between SBML and SBGN prevent direct comparison between the models.</p>\n<p>In this project, I will build tools to support bidirectional conversion between SBML and SBGN, which acts as a machinery to map between SBGN-specific and SBML-specific information. SBML Layout package will be used to represent SBML diagrams, and the SBML qual package used to store the logic model.</p>\n<p>Blog: <a href=\"http://haleyyew-gsoc.blogspot.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">http://haleyyew-gsoc.blogspot.ca/</a></p>\n<p>Repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/NRNB-GSoC2017-SBML2SBGNML-Converters/SBML2SBGNML\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/NRNB-GSoC2017-SBML2SBGNML-Converters/SBML2SBGNML</a></p>\n",

However, applying known algorithms may not be enough every time to extract the useful information. Some specialized queries may be helpful in this sence to extract more useful or more specific information. Actually, these types of queries are already implemented inside the PATIKAweb software that is a result of the study done by Doğrusöz et al. in Java programming language. The aim of this project is to move these implementations into the common use of developers by making an extension to Cytoscape.js, which is a commonly used graph drawing library written in Javascript. Cytoscape.js already includes some basic graph traversal algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal etc., but I believe that these specialized queries will provide a good functionality to be used in not only in biological networks, but also in other types of networks. With the advantage of compound node support in Cytoscape.js, these specialized traversal algorithms will also be easily applied to the large networks with compound node content.</p>\n",

Its simulations are driven by designs written in the domain-specific Infobiotics Language (IBL), which contains data that is then sent to the Biocompiler to be built into a Biocompiler Model internal structure.<br>\nCurrently, IBW offers limited support for two standard biological languages, the functionality-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and the design-based Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), a common medium of exchange for synthetic devices. While SBML is made use of by the simulation aspect of IBW, the design-based SBOL is used by the Biocompiler as a format to write its compiled design into. This project aims to enhance the Biocompiler’s ability to export and import SBOL and SBML. If IBW’s capacity to work with these two biological modelling standards is improved, its accessibility to computational biologists around the world would increase dramatically.

          "description": "<p>PiType is an already existing protein-protein interaction classifying tool created by my mentor.  It currently exists as both a web app and a standalone software package.  PiType is designed to classify proteins within a network into different categories: Mutually Exclusive (ME) vs Simultaneously Possible (SP) and Obligate (O) vs Non-Obligate (NO).  To do this, PiType takes a series of proteins within a network, analyses them to determine which of the above categories they fit into, and outputs that information as a table.  Because of the current input and output format, it is difficult for biologists to analyze and interpret the data. Cytoscape is open source software that provides numerous modules for studying and visualizing protein networks, and as such is the perfect tool to use for PiType. My project over the summer will thus be to create a Cytoscape plugin app using PiType’s already existent algorithms, to create a visualization tool that provides an intuitive interface for biologists.  By taking the base features of PiType, and implementing them as a Cytoscape plugin, my project will widen the number of potential users, and the utility of the app.</p>\n",

Many SBOL-compliant tools already exist which perform distinct and useful functions ranging from component design, modeling, composition, simulation, figure creation, storage, sharing, and publication. In 2016, ACS Synthetic Biology recommended that all authors submit genetic designs using SBOL. An example workflow for doing so was published in 2016 (Hillson), and each of the parts of the workflow can be fulfilled by extant tools, but the integrations between tools can be made more robust.  For example, the SynBioHub service allows for storage and sharing of SBOL parts, VisBOL allows for creation of SBOL visual images from SBOL files, and iBioSim and SBOL Designer allow for creation and composition of SBOL parts. SBOL Designer and iBioSim allow for upload of parts to an instance of SynBioHub, but there are many opportunities to improve this workflow with authentication, security, and sharing capabilities.</p>\n",

Consequently, several difficulties are found when improvements/changes need to be performed. This library is commonly described as too verbose, implying most of the times, string concatenations and mixed code for both presentation and logic. Subsequently, it is not much intuitive. In addition, recent patch update from 1.2.9 to 1.2.10 resulted in a backward compatibility break, and as a minor patch should not raise compatibility issues, the trust in this library is somehow compromised.\nTemplate Engines overcome the majority of the issues related to output generation. They are powerful tools that allow the developers to speed up their work in an easier and much cleaner way.</p>\n<p>This project proposes moving antiSMASH to jinja2, a well known, widely used and developer-friendly templating language for Python.

In this proposal, I first make a short report of the state-of-the-art detection/recognition techniques. To improve the framework for CNNs for 2D detection, I mainly focus on two key tasks that remain to be addressed.  The first one is to implement OD interface for training and testing neural network architectures with CNN and RNN. The second is to add several recognition/detection algorithms to OpenDetection. To this end, I decompose each task into several small tasks and propose my solutions respectively, aiming to perfect the project in an elegant way. I also create milestones for each small tasks. I can work on this project full-time during this summer and I’ve equipped myself with prior knowledge and programing experiences in object detection and deep learning, which makes me competent to this project.</p>\n",

The drms module needs testing, and some other packaging improvements to automatically run the tests. This might involve adoption of some of the Astropy packaging code such as astropy_helpers, if necessary.\nOnce the drms package has been well tested, CI added and a conda package created, the SunPy JSOC client could be improved and extended to enable use of the majority of the drms functionality through the unified search API of SunPy. While the SunPy implementation would not need to provide all the features of the drms library, it would strive to provide a simple API for most queries supported by drms.</p>\n",

It has mostly unified the interface in order to make these entities coalesce. However, the need for Astropy to shine as a single package and not just a collection of functionally independent modules, calls for seamless interoperability between the three special and powerful constituents of Astropy: coordinates, time and units and the underlying Astropy table writers. We seek to develop a protocol that allows their storage, the mixin columns, in FITS and ASCII ECSV, while still ensuring \"round-tripping\". Abiding by the rules set by the FITS standard, requires mapping of the special Astropy objects, with extensive associated metadata, to the standard keywords. We thus want to achieve the ideal goal of preserving complete information, while still going hand in hand with the defined standard.</p>\n",

This algorithm was presented by   Jonathan T. Barron and Ben Poole as an ECCV2016 oral and best paper nominee. Algorithm details and applications   can be found in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf</a> [1]</p>\n<p>Significance:\nThe naive bilateral filtering functions in OpenCV are generally computationally expensive and often insufficient for  solving more challenging computer vision tasks. By contrast, the bilateral solver is 10-1000× faster than existing  domain-specific approaches with comparable accuracy, and produces higher-quality output than lightweight filtering  techniques with comparable runtimes.</p>\n",

Two proposed bottom-up saliency methods use low level cues such as boundary connectivity, local contrast of the image areas to their surroundings and sliding window approach. The other proposed top-down saliency method uses high level cues pretrained on ImageNet. Three proposed saliency methods are all better than current OpenCV saliency module. With the result from multiple saliency methods,  background subtraction can be performed by using exponentially decaying method or aggregated saliency optimization framework. The proposed approach tend to be more robust when the background is highly dynamic or the camera is in motion compared with current OpenCV Background Subtraction module.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Web is the most vibrant open computing platform. With huge multimedia contents available on web, web developers are in need of wide array of image and vision processing algorithms in JavaScript to build innovative applications, such as facial detection in live WebRTC streaming. And this requirement is even more essential for emerging usages on web, such as Web Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (WebVR). The OpenCV is the de-facto standard C/C++ library for image and vision processing extensively used by computer vision community. But OpenCV is unavailable to web applications today. Thanks to OpenCV.js, an open source project initiated in Parallel Architectures and Systems Group at UC Irvine, by utilizing Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler, it makes the first step to prove OpenCV can be exposed to web with high performance. This proposal aims to merge OpenCV.js into official OpenCV repository which makes JavaScript as one of the language bindings of OpenCV. So it requires refactoring the structure, addressing several shortcomings and code optimization of existing OpenCV.js.</p>\n",

To implement this repository by the proposed deadline, I have decided to use the Django/Python framework, with PostgreSQL as the database backend, and for the front end Bootstrap was chosen. The OpenLayers library will also be used to render slippy maps to the user. The repository includes an user interface allowing uploading models from an authenticated OSM account through the OAuth mechanism, and an API for 3D visualizers to use, so that they can query the repository for models. Finally, while there were a plethora of interesting features that could be included in the deadline checklists, I have opted for only having the essential features required for a 3D repository as deliverables, with the rest as extra features, to be added if time allows it.</p>\n",

It would need to download stops and route relations, edit tags and relation members, keep nodes connected to ways, know about stop positions and platforms. See this write-up. The criteria for finished work will be a functioning and error-free web editor for stops and route relations. Way editing is not required (though it would be an interesting problem).</p>\n<p>Skills Required - JavaScript (+leaflet, +packaging, +xml processing, +some framework), HTML+CSS, OSM data model</p>\n<p>Difficulty - Medium</p>\n<p>Possible Mentors - Zverik</p>\n<p>Notes</p>\n<p>Comments\"</p>\n",

Therefore, a web application like Jangouts, implementing WebRTC expects to monitor the performance of the underlying network and media pipeline. As a solution to this problem, I propose to integrate callstats.io into Jangouts. callstats.io is a SaaS service that helps WebRTC services detect and diagnose media and network quality issues. This project aims to give an option to companies and individuals deploying Jangouts to use this service in a user-friendly way. This task can be completed by sending WebRTC events and measurement data from the Jangouts application and the Janus media server in real-time to callstats.io. The idea is to integrate the callstats.io REST API with the WebRTC components in Jangouts and Janus. The Jangouts app will send endpoint stats and Janus will send the stats related to the WebRTC gateway.</p>\n",

This printable ticket can be very useful as it can contain information about the conference (name, logo, location, date, etc.), user (name, email, etc.), the ticket type, a custom description and a QR code. Currently to do the check-in someone has to mark as present in the conference one by one every user by looking for its name or email.

The API fetches the OSM data in real time based on a bounding box, or uses a local file or the data itself in GeoJSON format. The project focuses on the performance of the visualization of 3D OSM buildings, and for this purpose creates triangle meshes based on the footprint available in OSM database. Height to the buildings can be assigned using the OSM database, a property in a GeoJSON file or an arbitrary value. The API can also create a heatmap based on the heights of the buildings. The API also offers caching and sectorizing (tiling) to improve the performance.</p>\n",

I would like to contribute to the idea of <strong>Virtual Room</strong> this summers and be a part of the community. Recently I have been involved with a lot of real time applications .The hidden motivation behind choosing this project is mainly due to an application I recently developed, Latch for a hackathon. It is a Location based chat application, using Django as the primary backend server and Node.js for real time data handling. I already had an idea of developing a similar video based application which introduced me to WebRTC. I saw this project of Virtual Room in P2PSP, and the idea of an open source real time video streaming application fascinated me a lot. I believe that it could be very useful and can create an impact on the community.</p>\n",

PEcAn already has an interface with Shiny (R) for visualizations and the main aim of this project would be to work upon the existing Shiny apps as well as developing other powerful visualizations to convey the right amount of information as well as clear understanding to the users on the platform. For me, an important component of this project is to understand what kind of visualization would give an intuitive sense to any user given the data and to present them in a very clear and effective manner. Otherwise, the user could not draw inferences that we want to show them.

Any UPDATE or DELETE statement on a Primary Key table would trigger an IR constraint violation check on the Foreign Key table which can only be accomplished by a sequential search.

Since GIN-Indexes seem very reasonable since GIN is primarily used to search for element values (PK values) that appear within composite items (FK array).  This would greatly decrease the computation time since we can utilize the GIN class operator “&lt;@” (included in).

          "description": "<p>To provide strict serializable isolation among transactions, PostgreSQL needs to track read-write conflicts (rw-conflicts for short in the following context) executed concurrently at runtime. PostgreSQL uses a double-linked list in the shared memory to record all conflicts of each transaction. Based on the list structure, the rw-conflict tracking has a time complexity of O(N^2). The designer assumed that the list is short so that the overhead can be ignored. However, some benchmarks reported that the conflict-tracking took up to half the CPU time at high concurrency levels, where searching the list becomes a bottleneck. There are five static functions existing in the project to manage the rw-conflicts. We intend to rewrite these functions by replacing linked list with other data structures to support faster search. There are two possible replacements. Hash table is the first choice because there is an existing implementation of hash table (HTAB) in shared memory in PostgreSQL. Skip list is the other choice as it is similar to the linked list.</p>\n",

It also adds a weight normalization option to the LCMV beamformer (neural activity index and unit noise gain), which will be available for other LCMV versions as well.\nFurthermore, statistical testing of the Hilbert beamformer output using the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be implemented to complete the new Hilbert beamformer pipeline.

Applications are wide, ranging from electronics, process control, machine design, physiology, and economics to ecosystems, climate modeling, electrical power devices and systems, and several others. The transfer function and state-space systems are math representations of the dynamic system and would be explored significantly within the project.\nThe object of this project is to create a control toolbox for R language based on RLabplus and submitting it to CRAN as a package.

Time series modeling using sentiment from text requires its own package because of the intrinsic challenge that for a given text we can compute sentiment in hundreds of different ways, as well as the large number of possibilities to pool sentiment across text and time. This additional layer of manipulation does not exist in standard time series analysis. The package aims to derive the optimal sentiment extraction and aggregation for the forecasting task. Aggregation can be optimized across several dimensions, for example word term weighting schemes or time lag structures. The package created therefore integrates the qualification of sentiment from text, the aggregation into different sentiment measures and the optimized forecasting based on these measures. No such integrated textual sentiment forecasting approach exists in any R package. The goal is to provide an automated means to measure the impact of sentiment in texts on a given variable, obtaining readily interpretable and useful outputs and an object to play with, when using this package.</p>\n",

A new class tbl_ts will be defined and provided for representing regular time series in a tidy data structure.

New calendar-based arrangements created using linear algebra tools will be developed to display temporal data in a format that captures people’s daily schedules. A new faceting system that attempts to reflect a nested structure will be experimented, which would provide a visualisation framework for hierarchical and grouped time series data.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The aim of this project is to provide a standalone, scalable, and extensible R package that unifies existing methodologies for estimating the empirical cluster tree.</p>\n<p>In 1975, John Hartigan established a statistical definition of a high-density cluster. High-density clusters are defined on a population with density <em>f</em> in <em>r</em> dimensions to be the maximal connected sets of form <em>{ x : f(x) &gt;= lambda }</em>, for any <em>lambda &gt; 0</em>. Varying this density level lambda across all possible density thresholds forms a hierarchy of density level sets known as the cluster tree.</p>\n<p>In 1981, the asymptotic behavior of various linkage criteria were studied by by Hartigan in the context of the cluster tree. During this effort,  a notion of consistency---now often referred to as \"Hartigan consistency\"---was introduced. In the same seminal paper, single-linkage was proven by Hartigan to be inconsistent for dimensions <em>r &gt;= 2</em>.</p>\n<p>It was not until 2010 that the first computationally tractable and provably consistent algorithm for estimating the cluster tree for  <em>r &gt;= 2</em> was proven. These results have undoubtedly played a large role in rekindling a number of recent research efforts related to the cluster tree.</p>\n",

First, the implementation of the existing estimators will be optimised, resulting in a significant speed gain. This will make the methods usable for higher dimensions, as required by many practitioners. Second, I will add a full range of state-of-the-art higher order comoment estimators, currently not available for the community. Since these estimators greatly improve the accuracy of estimating the skewness and kurtosis of linear combinations of random variables, all functions in PerformanceAnalytics and PortfolioAnalytics depending on these moments will be more reliable. This is in particular important for risk or performance measures depending on higher order moments in the package PerformanceAnalytics, as well as certain objective functions or constraints in the package PortfolioAnalytics.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Modeling the volatility of financial markets is central in risk management. A seminal contribution in this field was the development of the GARCH model by Bollerslev (1986) where the volatility is a function of past asset returns. The GARCH model is today a widespread tool in risk management. However, recent studies show that estimates of GARCH models can be biased by structural breaks in the volatility dynamics (Bauwens et al., 2010; Bauwens et al., 2014). These structural breaks typically occur during periods of financial turmoil. Estimating a GARCH model on data displaying a structural break yields a non-stationary estimated model and implies poor risk predictions. A way to cope with this problem is provided by Markov-switching GARCH models (MSGARCH) whose parameters vary over time according to some regimes. These models can quickly adapt to variations in the unconditional volatility level, which improves risk predictions (see Ardia, 2008).</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>I propose to train a deep neural network to discriminate between various kinds of laughter (giggle, snicker, etc.) A convolutional neural network can be trained to produce continuous-valued vector representations (embeddings) for spectrograms of audio data. A triplet-loss function during training can constrain the network to learn an embedding space where Euclidean distance corresponds to acoustic similarity. In such a space, algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors can be used for classification. The network weights can be visualized to glean insight about the low- and high-level features it has learned to look for (pitch, timbre, unknowns, etc.) I also propose to obtain visualizations of the embedding space of laughter sounds using dimension reduction techniques like Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). I will also apply these same techniques techniques directly on the high-dimension audio spectrograms. All techniques proposed here have been applied previously on related problems in audio and image processing.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This project aims to build a large-scale speaker recognition system for tagging speakers in CNN news recordings upon the existing Red Hen audio processing pipeline. The current speaker recognition system of the pipeline although fully functional, is not yet ready for processing news videos archived in the NewsScape. The main reason is lack of training data from relevant speakers to enroll into the system. Manually extracting such training data by human experts is inefficient, time-consuming or even infeasible at large scale. On the other hand, for a significant part of the archive (videos recorded over a decade since 2007), there are transcripts (the tpt files) that contain caption and speaker information saved along with the videos. These transcripts can potentially be used to automatically extract speaker training data, if they are accurately aligned with the audios. Therefore, the core idea of this proposal is to establish a workflow in the current audio pipeline from Gentle alignment to accurate timestamps of speech boundaries, then to speaker training data, and finally to identified speakers.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Auditory stimuli like music, radio recordings, movie soundtracks or the regular speech are widely used in research. While it is easy for a human to recognize the emotional load of Bach symphonies, how can it be done by a computer? Currently, algorithms are able to analyze low level features like signals energy. Those features are far from capturing how does the stimuli actually sound to us, and the best we can do is to ask a human subject to judge.\nThe following project aims to bridge the gap between human- and machine-like sound understanding by building an audio embedding space. Such embeddings have been proven extremely successful for texts (word2vec) and images (image recognition, convolutional neural networks, vgg). The aim of this project is to offer similar insight into the nature of the audio stimuli. \nThe embedding space will be obtained by a machine learning model trained to perform on various audio task. Deliverables are: the architecture (data loading and preprocessing pipeline, deep neural network for universal feature extraction and classifiers train separately for each task), ready-to-load optimized parameters, and a use case tutorial (github repository).</p>\n",

However, for a mobile robot that operates around people, these traditional algorithms may not follow the social norms. Even simple conventions like move to the right when a person is encountered might not be honored by these algorithms.

Modular decomposition is decomposition of graph into modules. A module is a subset of vertices and it is a generalization of connected component in graph. Let us take for example a module X. For any vertex v ∉ X it is either connected or not connected to every vertex of X. Another property of module is that a module can be subset of another module. There are various algorithms which have been published for modular decomposition of graphs. The focus in this project is on linear time complexity algorithms which can be practically implemented. The project further aims to use the modules developed for modular decomposition to implement other functionality like skew partitions. Skew partition is partition of graph into two sets of vertices such that induced graph formed by one set is disconnected and induced graph formed by other set is complement of the first. \nModular decomposition is a very important concept in Graph Theory and it has a number of use cases. For instance it has been an important tool for solving optimization and combinatorics problems.</p>\n",

Precise measurement of execution time is important in area about life safety, such as military equipments, automotive and aerospace industries.\nAs we known, Matlab has a Profiler function which could measure where a program spends time. By using Matlab Profiler, we could evaluate and improve performance of programs. What I want to do is to make a similar function for Scilab.\nWe use Xcos to make models that have many blocks. In some cases, we want to know execution time of these blocks. A variety of literatures introduce the way of measuring execution time but they did not present directly time to users.

The project will be divided into two parts: In the first part, I plan to perform data cleaning and apply various machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC dataset for mortality prediction, predict the risk of developing certain diseases, determine the effectiveness of certain drugs, and more.

The scale of problems and the amount of data available have made it infeasible to solve a meaningful problem in a single computer. As such, in such a scale, it is imperative to combine CPUs and accelerator cards such as GPUs to achieve one unified computing source. HPXCL aims at unifying kernel launch and data transfer into HPX asynchronous graph through seamless integration. However, the current implementation of the system with CUDA fails to achieve the desired performance improvement metrics while running in a cluster of computers. The proposal is aimed at improving the performance of CUDA-based HPXCL applications through an ‘Event’ triggered mechanism. Appropriate tests are also to be written to ensure necessary functionality performs as required. Standard benchmarking algorithms (Floyd Warshall, FFT etc.) will also be implemented in HPXCL, OpenCL and CUDA to validate, measure and improve the performance of the existing system, while also keeping in mind the new functionality added.</p>\n",

To get started with “music blocks”, newbies need to have a fundamental understanding of the software, what are the things can be done and importantly how things can be done. To address this requirement, “music block” has a user guide. But the existing user guide lacks most of the important information about the software components,  how each building blocks in the software can be related to music and especially some examples of how to create music with the software. The objective of this project is to create a user manual which would be a simple and comprehensive guide while providing samples and related explanations. Deliverables of the project will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the Music blocks user guide content to be easily approachable to newbies. </li>\n<li>Implement a documentation website for Music Blocks user guide. </li>\n<li>Prepare a downloadable version of the Music Blocks user manual in Portable Document Format(PDF).</li>\n<li>Make the website expandable for online contributions to documentation from the website itself.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Ethereum blockchain is one example, that gives users to develop \"smart contracts\" that runs in the blockchain. This gives the ability to develop decentralized applications (or dApps).</p>\n<p>This framework has given many developers to write a decentralized application without much effort, without needing distributed systems or cryptography knowledge. Unfortunately, because the technology being used is bleeding edge it is inevitable that attacks or hacks will target these apps for monetary reasons.\nBecause of the immutability property of Ethereum after publishing even if developers identify a critical bug in the contract it is not possible to correct it.</p>\n<p>Thus, in order to fill the gap of not having a proper 'smart contract' compatible monitoring service, we propose to build a web application that can monitor other smart contracts in Ethereum and give the capability to safeguard its critical functions (Ether send and receive) and interact and visualize with smart contract functions in a much simpler way.</p>\n",

This would yield important insights about the correlation between patterns of ties in a social network.

Rubi utilizes a set of well defined rules which makes it smart to present the results in a more symmetric and simplified manner. The Pattern Matcher along with transformation rules plays an important role in making Rubi more robust and fast.

But hex-meshing is a hard problem and is often done by parameterizing tetrahedral meshes and extracting hexahedral meshes using certain heuristic rules. Numerical inconsistencies and extraction of non-hexahedral polytopes can be avoided at the extraction stage.\nThe algorithm to be implemented is delineated in the paper by Lyon et al: HexEx: Robust Hexahedral Mesh Extraction. My work is to incorporate the algorithm to create hexahedral meshes using combinatorial maps package in CGAL.</p>\n<p>CGAL has a generalized maps package, which generalizes representation of any oriented object of n-dimensions with n-dimensional subdivisions, each of which is stored as a set of darts and pointers that point to other darts, which could be thought of as an oriented edge or 1-cell. We use this data structure to hold the hexahedral subdivisions of the 3D object. The package has classes to define implementations of darts, cells, generalized maps, which will be used for the implementation.</p>\n",

Although APP4MC provides sufficient tooling in parallel computing for automotive domain, the demonstration and evaluation of its results would improve its performance and allow to investigate the optimization of goals such as resource usage and energy consumption.

Many development tasks require to create and modify JSON files based on a given JSON Schema. As the implementation of custom editors for every JSON schema is quite some effort, JSON files are often created with plain text editors. The goal of this project is to create a framework for the creation of tree-based editors for JSON files based on a given JSON schema. The schema defines which elements and attributes are supported by the editor and how the tree can be structured. This information is parsed by the framework and a running editor is created based on this information. If required, additional editor-related features can be specified, e.g. which icons are used in the tree. The implementation will be based on the existing open source framework JSON Forms.</p>\n",

Defending and fighting against malicious attacks requires tools and techniques to recognize their origin, family, actor, purpose and modus operandi. In this project, I will develop a system that can use a wide range of malware analytic outputs (source code, DNS/ASN data, peinfo results, yara rules, IPs, domains etc.) to automatically detect relationships  between malicious objects in a database and assign a score to each detected relationship. This system should accept user requests for analytic jobs and utilize distributed machine learning techniques and tools in order to extract knowledge out of the malware-related Big Data available.

However, the “inverse problem”, the problem of parameter estimation based on the measurements of output variables, has not been well explored using modern optimization and statistical methods. Parameter estimation aims to find the unknown parameters of the model which give the best fit to a set of experimental data. In this way, parameters which cannot be measured directly will be determined in order to ensure the best fit of the model with the experimental results. This will be done by globally minimizing an objective function which measures the quality of the fit.

          "description": "<p>Likelihood-based methods have many appealing features, but they are difficult to use for models which do not have a closed-form, tractable likelihood function. When these models can be solved numerically and simulated, indirect inference can be used. In a Bayesian context, this approach is called Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). ABC methods using an extension of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Marjoram et al 2003) allow sampling from the posterior using simulation, but are not effective for larger dimensions. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Neal 2012) and related algorithms can overcome these problems when the likelihood is available. Hamiltonian Approximate Bayesian Computation combines the ABC methodology with the Hamiltonian approach.</p>\n",

Interact.jl and Escher.jl are good libraries that have the potential to be extremely powerful for these tasks, but currently Interact only supports IJulia and Escher suffers some stability issues. WebIO.jl looks to be a promising path forward for building web based components that are created by or interface with Julia. Rebuilding Interact.jl on top of WebIO.jl will bring Interact beyond IJulia, to the Atom/Juno IDE and to desktop apps with Electron/Blink.jl. Additionally it should enable Escher.jl to reuse much of Interact, which will likely reduce Escher’s size and complexity significantly, increasing its stability. Furthermore, by removing its dependence on Jupyter and IPywidgets, Interact will gain flexibility to produce more complex UIs which intermix displayed data such as plots, and UI controls. Finally, I plan to add some automated UI testing which hopefully will assist in improving the stability of not just Interact and Escher, but potentially IJulia, Juno, and Blink as well.</p>\n",

Therefore there exists a need for extension so that other methods, such as ECDSA or EDDSA can be used easily. Implementation of RFC 7427 would solve this problem as the new digital signature method is flexible enough to include all current signature methods (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, RSASSA-PSS, etc.) and add new methods (ECGDSA, ElGamal, etc.) in the future.</p>\n",

But some NAT rules even drop the UDP packets, only allowing TCP streams to go through. TCP encapsulation can reach through to hosts behind such NATs. An initiator must always try to send IKE_SA_INIT over UDP first, and if there are a certain number of transmission fails then only it should fall back to TCP. Another thing to do would be to schedule checks for UDP so we can go to establishing the tunnel using UDP if it becomes available and tear down the TCP IPsec tunnel. The above two steps are to be done as TCP encapsulation adds overheads and has performance trade offs compared to UDP, therefore we should always prefer using UDP unless required otherwise. Once the TCP support is added, we need to look into enabling ESPinTCP support in the kernel. The kernel must be able to identify TCP packets where the first 4 bytes are zero and we must tell the kernel to process ESPinTCP packets. Everything else will be done by following the draft RFC draft-ietf-ipsecme-tcp-encaps-09.</p>\n",

This also includes building releases, testing them and debugging the system files (written in C) to make them work. Currently, Anita only has support for qemu (and experimental support for running NetBSD as Xen DomU). Unlike BSD, Linux has a kernel module known as KVM, which allows a user space program to utilize the hardware virtualization features of various processors and can be utilized by qemu to provide “KVM acceleration” when the target architecture is the same as host architecture. The lack of such support makes qemu really slow on NetBSD. Testing system installation on a wide variety of platforms is very crucial for any organisation that’s into OS business. It can be a frustrating task to do that manually, but, if neglected can be a make or break situation for the OS (adoption/marketing). Automated testing with Anita makes the job a cakewalk. Support for Xen and Virtualbox will further enhance the capabilities of Anita.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>MIPv6 is the base standard from the IETF for IP based mobility management in wireless networks. The next generation mobility management schemes are mainly following the protocol stack of MIPv6. Until today ns-3 – which aims to replace the aging ns2 and its associated old-featured simulators –  does not have even in its latest version a MIPv6 module that is fully compliant to the IETF specification. To fill this gap, I am going to implement a novel MIPv6 simulation model which can be integrated into ns-3.\nThe project idea aims at testing the code in different network scenarios, containing different link layer technologies such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and LTE. The current implementation of LTE does not have support of IPv6 in ns-3. So, the idea of testing MIPv6 code into LTE would follow IPv6 support implementation in LTE first and then the MIPv6 support. So, ns-3 researchers can benefit themselves with the addition of this feature. \nThus, implementation of MIPv6 in ns-3 as the base mobility management solution and providing LTE support within it could help the current network researchers working on ns-3.</p>\n",

DCTCP starves the throughput of other TCP flows (e.g., Reno, Cubic, etc) when they co-exist; so one of the goals is to ensure that TCP Prague can co-exist with other TCP flows without degrading their throughput. Although TCP Prague is still a work in progress, some related modules have been finalised and briefly experimented, such as: the Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S) service architecture, DualQ Coupled AQM, Modified ECN Semantics for Ultra Low Queueing Delay. Availability of these modules in network simulators like ns-3 is crucial to boost up the ongoing efforts of standardizing TCP Prague. In this project, the aim is to implement the above mentioned modules in ns-3. Additionally, the functionality of these modules will be tested, and the necessary documentation with some examples will also be provided.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>In PSNs, sometimes it is not possible to distinguish and manipulate different kinds of network flows. For example, we may want to give priority to some flows while limiting bandwidth of other flows or even perform packet classification. To solve such problems, we have a traffic control layer in ns-3 which intercepts the packets flowing between the L2 Net devices and any IP protocol. It uses several qdiscs like pfifo, HBT, RED, CoDel etc., in order to process these packets and perform scheduling or shaping. Currently the ns-3 traffic layer only contains traffic scheduling qdisc models (AQMs) and lacks realistic traffic shaping algorithms. This project aims to introduce the TBF and HHF algorithms into the ns-3 traffic control layer. TBF is a classless traffic shaper, that is used to control the flow rate or bandwidth of the throughput. HHF is a size-based qdisc that attempts to differentiate small and heavy flows. The goal is to catch the heavy flows and move them to a separate queue with less priority so that bulk traffic does not affect the latency of critical traffic.</p>\n",

A subset of fuzzers uses code-coverage as feedback when permuting and choosing inputs, among them the popular user-space fuzzer American Fuzzy Lop. Recently there have been attempts to port fuzzers to the kernel and in a similar manner should now the hypercall interface of Xen be tested.</p>\n<p>While this is overall a very comprehensive problem this project will help to develop a better understanding of the problem space and make at least first advances of the source tree into the necessary direction. A generic mechanism will be implemented allowing fuzzers to obtain feedback on code-coverage. In the next step this output will be further processed in order to actually run a particular fuzzer (such as AFL), although there might not be sufficient time to commit this to the source tree.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the overall steps to getting a fuzzer running are the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extracting the execution path from the hypervisor via a hypercall</li>\n<li>Parse the execution path into a format consumable by a user-space fuzzer</li>\n<li>Drive a domU to execute the test cases of the fuzzer</li>\n</ol>\n",

          "description": "<p>Having a great development environment is one of the many things that ensure ease of developing software. It increases productivity and interest in software building. Another very important aspect in software development is testing. With a strong testing infrastructure, the cases of buggy code being patched to production can be reduced a lot. Also the load on committers/reviewers drops down drastically with this as obvious bugs fail to pass the automatic testing phase and alerting the developers that something has gone wrong before they ask for reviews. Through this project we can aspire to improve upon both these aspects and hence result in a big enhancement to the developer experience. This project will involve clearing out various issues relating to enhancement requests tied to these areas as well as developing new tools to support our vision of a better development and testing infrastructure.</p>\n",

It is easy to get started, I used it to contact mentors, discuss in the community etc. I have also deployed a local server in my hostel wing. It resulted in complete success to do various discussions. The best part is you never miss a message even if a server has thousands of users; unread counts are managed, get email and desktop notifications. It’s like impossible to miss a single message even after long vacations. It is an awesome tool for startups and companies to chat and discuss ideas.</p>\n<p>The project idea aims to enhance current React-Native app, increase user experience, fix bugs, polish app, and add new features.</p>\n",

I am excited to work on Zulip because the project is very eager to welcome beginners to Open Source and is interested in helping people grow-- I would be able to learn a lot by working with such a dynamic team. I believe this project would be able to showcase the importance of designers contributing to Open Source, demonstrating that spending a few months improving the front-end of a project can make it more appealing and easier to use!</p>\n",

Outgoing webhooks are integrations which send data to third party services from Zulip on being triggered. Slash commands enable users to make use of services through chat messages. Example: change topic, archive messages, etc. I wish to build an outgoing webhook system which will enable users to easily add outgoing webhooks into their Zulip realm through UI. Users can also use their own code by adding it to the codebase for complex uses. I also wish to add support for slash commands which can be enabled, disabled and managed by users.</p>\n",
