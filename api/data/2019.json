          "description": "<p>Optimization of complex systems is one of the biggest challenges in engineering. A system can be considered complex when its consisted of more sub-systems and when nonlinear interactions between its various design parameters and sub-systems are present. Optimizing such systems can be a challenge for human designers who can neither directly identify optimal design points nor manualy investigate a large design space to identify optimal solutions. In order to tackle this problem, algorithmic optimization approaches are required. Genetic algorithms can successfully navigate a large and nonlinear design space but their performance is highly dependent on the selection of various hyper-parameters. At its current form the optimization problem is concerned with the design of an electric propulsion unit for small satellites. This project aims in the development of visualization tools that will aid in better understanding such complex optimization processes. By developing visualization tools for the optimization process and the sub-systems' characteristics the algorithm's performance can be further enhanced and new insights that can prove valuable for human designers can be identified.</p>\n",

Among its tools are a shader generator, which mutates a shader program into variants that differ in machine code, but render a similar image to the original - and a shader reducer, which reduces shader code to focus on specific logic that a user is interested in. Used in tandem, these tools allow one to fuzz test shader compilers for flaws and easily reproduce them.</p>\n<p>The generator mutates a shader by performing \"transformations\" on the original code which complicate control/data flow. These transformations often make use of OpenGL's built-in functions and features to mutate expressions into equivalent forms.</p>\n<p>However, the generator and reducer are only aware of a subset of the OpenGL shader language, and do not support all of OpenGL's built-in math and transformation functions. This reduces the number of potential mutations and ultimately hampers GraphicsFuzz's capability of finding edge cases.</p>\n<p>This project aims to enhance GraphicsFuzz's support for OpenGL semantics and extend its capabilities with new transformations, then apply them to open-source drivers.</p>\n",

Students are supposed to integrate cruise calculation to the extension too. This would help more people who use extension to calculate the carbon emission.

This most commonly appears as pronoun resolution where we need to identify the antecedent in the source context. Apertium works with resource-poor languages and the information available isn’t as linguistically complex as parse trees. Hence there is a need for a tool which resolves anaphora using simple linguistic information.</p>\n<p>Instead of the current system, which chooses a default male for pronoun resolution, this tool will use linguistic features to assign saliency scores to the possible antecedents. The highest scored antecedent is picked for possessive, reflexive, zero pronouns and long-distance relations like agreement in adjectives. This formalism is language agnostic and the features make use of only POS tags and basic gender and number information. I will test it on Spanish, Catalan, English, Russian, French, etc.</p>\n<p>When implemented, this tool will increase the fluency and intelligibility of the Apertium Translation Output of any pair it is used with.

The ability to autonomously detect a power failure and safely execute an autorotation will add a greater level of redundancy to the ArduCopter firmware.

Following this, preliminary investigations show that main rotor head momentum is a critical factor.  A methodology is proposed to scale a generic velocity trajectory using the main rotor head momentum in hover.  The trajectory will be empirically determined through SITL and real-life testing.  The resulting flight mode will provide a robust approach to completing an autorotation manoeuvre for any helicopter.  An overview plan of how development time will be allocated, over the GSoC period, is presented.  Finally, a short section detailing my background follows.</p>\n",

A user can post an instance and others can only interact by either reacting on the instance (Like the instance), or by posting an answer to that instance. But, Question Tool currently has very less user interaction because of no notifications or emails about what is happening with any instance idea or with their replies. Question tool’s user experience is also not upto the marks as per now, which can also be the possible reason for some users less collaboration.

It is based on a system that now needs\nmajor changes.\nA lot of research has been done in adaptive cloth simulation (which is the next big step towards\nbeing able to do realistic cloth simulation in reasonable computation time). By introducing adaptive\ncloth simulation into Blender, we can decrease the computation time per frame, thereby leading to a\nbetter quality of simulation in the same amount of time. Furthermore, it would then be possible to\nbuild really powerful cloth production pipelines. The current cloth production pipeline is slow and\nrequires a lot of user interaction (for example, for adding the correct level of topology and\nredefining the stitches each time the topology changes). With the introduction of adaptive cloth\nsimulation, the algorithm can automatically determine the necessary topology to get the correct\ncollisions and realistic folds and wrinkles. Additionally, this project would act as the base for future\nimprovements, such as adding contact friction and dynamic tearing of cloth.</p>\n",

Boost.YAP already offers a lot of functions and algorithms for dealing with expressions.

          "description": "<p>Real serves to tackle the pervasive problem of inaccuracy that arises from floating point arithmetic. However, there is still much to be done to get to a peer review ready state. I propose to optimize the memory usage of Real. By changing the way real_explicit stores numbers, we can reduce memory usage of real_explicit by an order of magnitude. Utilizing std::variant, we can reduce the memory used by a real number to that of either a real_operation, real_explicit, or real_algorithm. I propose to better the way Real deals with operations, in particular, by simplifying sums of multiples of the same number. Further, I propose to implement benchmarking using Google Benchmark, to allow direct comparison between Real and other representations. After this, Boost.Real may be ready for peer review.</p>\n",

LibreCAD 3 was designed to have multiple rendering engines without major modifications to its core. \nRight now LibreCAD 3 uses Cairo for rendering. For users with high resolution screens, Cairo is not convenient because of a slowness, due to a bad integration with Qt and a missing caching system. At each frame when rendering is done the data is sent from CPU to GPU which is very inefficient.\nOpenGL has lower CPU overhead for draw calls and state changes and lets you take advantage of the GPU to render graphics on your device's screen and performance is excellent.\nThe project consists of replacing Cairo with OpenGL in LibreCAD 3.To make a complete well abstracted OpenGL implementation  with C++ for the rendering in LibreCAD.</p>\n",

These provide many new opportunities for genomic research, but the integration of these different resources is currently poor. In particular, turning models of human history into evolutionary models is notoriously time-consuming and bug-prone, and it requires knowledge of the specifics of each simulation tool. The major goals of this project are to develop a library of widely used historical models that integrate across multiple simulation tools, and to develop more robust and user-friendly model specification tools to automate the workflow of genomic and evolutionary analyses.</p>\n",

An inconvenience for both biologists trying to get valuable information to make informed decisions on prognosis and patients who would like to readily have access to this information for their own comfort, is the time needed to access this data. As the genomic data sets for each study vary in size, viewing annotations for studies that have large data sets in real-time is a challenge because it takes a while for the information to load. For example: MSK-IMPACT 2017 has a data set of 10,000 samples, so it will take a few minutes for the study view to load. I would like to work on the three backend tasks and first frontend task. This means pre-annotating the mutation data and storing it into the MySQL database and creating an additional column in the mutation table called “annotation”. Querying and using the web API to provide the information needed to solve the front-end goal of creating pie charts for oncogenicity and highest level of sensitive therapeutic implications per sample.</p>\n",

Our main goal here is to train a deep learning model in python using all of its symptoms for the prediction of early onset of sepsis. Depending upon the values fed into the application, a doctor should get a good idea whether a person is susceptible to sepsis and get an early alert which can be critical for diagnosis. The application should be able to make these predictions using only a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real-time. During the course of this project, new deep learning methods, using temporal convolutional neural networks or quasi RNN, a model will be developed to identify markers that predict the onset of sepsis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit.

          "description": "<p>In this project we intend to integrate publicly available -omic and clinical datasets using natural language processing techniques. Combining genomics data with physiologic read-outs may be effective in creating robust machine learning and data analysis pipeline. The example microarray gene expression data can be downloaded from GEO (<a href=\"https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn5612563\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn5612563</a>) and physiologic data from eICU (<a href=\"https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/</a>). The idea is to map phenotypic terms to causal genes (for sepsis) and follow the SIRS timeline to form the integrated data set. After that robust machine learning models can be formed using the integrated data and compared with already existing models.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This project aims to develop a novel method of automatically synchronizing the lyrics of a song to its corresponding audio, i.e. a line from the lyrics is displayed at the corresponding moment in the song in which that line is sung. The primary method through which this synchronization will be done is through syllabic analysis. Applications exist where the number of syllables spoken in an audio file can be extracted without processing the words themselves, resulting in much faster runtimes. By similarly analyzing the number of syllables in a chunk of text, a process for which several very good algorithms exist, we can roughly match the timestamp of each syllable in the audio file to the corresponding syllable in the lyrical text. This process would take place in a separate module than the actual SwagLyric application so as to facilitate speed of retrieval when the user is actually streaming. Several obstacles, which will be discussed in more detail, exist: these include stripping away background music and getting specific audio information from Spotify’s stream.</p>\n",

Dedicated physicists and engineers have constructed a system that has served the collaboration well, but the approaching HL-LHC upgrade, which will produce about an <em>exabyte</em> of data per year, demands a more economic solution. Fortunately, the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) has been collecting data describing global and local access patterns that can be used to model the response of alternative, novel infrastructures that may better serve High Energy Physics for decades. Furthermore, with the advent and ever-growing popularity of \"Big Data\" in industry, the optimization philosophy of the CMS data infrastructure, as well as the predictive power of the project itself, will have relevance far beyond experimental physics.</p>\n",

Not only is a Kalman Filter more reliable about predicting future state than traditional extrapolation techniques, It also provides a confidence for the estimate. A Kalman Filter is used both to reduce the impact of sensor noise on estimations, and to determine which sensors can be “trusted” more than others. Whereas more primitive methods for estimation and extrapolation rely on some form of averaging, a Kalman Filter forecasts by developing a weighted covariance for each sensor input.</p>\n<p>The aim of this project is to implement a Kalman Filter in Rust. Rust has gained popularity for providing more compile-time checks than other systems-level languages, namely C and C++. Rust’s memory model ensures that there is little to no room for many of the memory pitfalls common in other low level languages, such as double-freeing memory, dangling pointers, and user-after-free errors. This, in conjunction with high runtime performance, leads writing components of a codebase in Rust to be favorable for both speed and stability.</p>\n",

In this project, two other libraries that can be used with CGAL are considered: OpenGR and pointmatcher. Although OpenGR has a wrapper to work with CGAL types, it suffers from duplication of the point type due to lack of proper abstraction layer. For pointmatcher, there does not exist a wrapper, i.e., an interoperability channel to use its ICP method on a CGAL point cloud that global registration is applied. The first goal of this project is to introduce an abstraction layer around point and normal type for the OpenGR library, so that, CGAL types can be directly used. The second goal is to have a new wrapper for the pointmatcher library  that will provide an ICP method that can be applied after the global registration to a CGAL point cloud.</p>\n",

The k-dop whose facets are determined by hyperplanes with outer normals in a fixed number of directions is a generalisation of the bounding box, and it is promising to be more efficient and flexible than the AABB tree in the intersection search.

For example, they can be used in terms of benchmarks to determine the variance of a processed geometry from a given ground-truth model.</p>\n<p>One such similarity measure is the Hausdorff distance. Given two compact subsets A, B of a metric space, the one-sided Hausdorff distance between A and B is defined as the distance between an element a from A and an element b from B, where a is chosen to maximize the distance and b is chosen to minimize it. Intuitively speaking, the Hausdorff distance measures the maximum deviation between two models.</p>\n<p>The project consists of implementing the algorithm for interactive Hausdorff distance computation presented by Tang, Lee, and Kim. While it provides an approximation to the Hausdorff distance - as already present in the CGAL framework - it ensures the computed measure to be within a user-specified error bound.

Data can be extracted from the Talk Bank (<a href=\"https://dementia.talkbank.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DementiaBank</a>) or, for example, <a href=\"https://dementiadiaries.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Dementia Diaries</a> website.\nThe app could prompt their users to talk about their day and using speech recognition module could analyze the possibility of Alzheimer and changes overtime.</p>\n",

For achieving this I plan to have a generic approach for bears to pass their own applicable actions which can then be used to write a generic bear which can offer multiple patches. This can be followed by Implementation for templated patches and interactive diff behavior along with writing tests supporting these new functionalities. Finally thorough testing and exception handling should be done to fix bugs and designing alternate approaches if necessary(e.g. resolve conflicts of multiple bears on a single issue by git like conflict markers through IDE). I would be updating the documentation throughout the project. An optional task would be implementing output formats for the enhanced features and their processing functions being implemented in the Linter class if time permits.</p>\n",

Primary issue is bloat of irreclaimable memory due to pipe-pages. Pipe buffers are pinned in memory making them non swappable. Pipes have maximum size restriction, so there could be many pipes which results in memory pressure during pre-dump process. Replacing pipe-pages with userspace supplied buffer from CRIU will alleviate this memory pressure. Since, the buffer pages can be swapped out.</p>\n<p>Another issue is duration for which pre-dump algorithm freezes the target task. Use case like live migration expects smallest possible freezing glitch. So, objective is to reduce this freeze time during pre-dump.</p>\n<p>To achieve both of these objectives, we use process_vm_readv system call with a set of VMA-list gathered by freezing target task for minimal amount of time. There are challenges in handling memory areas with this approach, like race conditions resulting in false reads. Development of graceful solution for these challenges is objective of this project.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Natural Language Generation is the process of generating coherent natural language text from non-linguistic data. Though the community has been generally going for speech and text output for these models, there has been far less certainty in the inputs. A large number of inputs have been taken for NLG systems including images, numeric data, semantic representations and Semantic Web (SW) data. Presently, the generation of Natural Language from  SW, more precisely RDF data, has gained substantial attention and has also been proved to support the creation of NLG benchmarks. However, most models are aimed at generating coherent sentences in English, whilst other languages have enjoyed comparatively less attention from researchers. RDF data is usually in the form of triples, \n. Subject denotes the resource, predicate denotes traits or aspects of the resource and expresses the relationship between subject and object.</p>\n<p>In this project we aim to create a multilingual Neural verbalizer, ie, generating high-quality natural-language text from sets of RDF triples in multiple languages using one stand-alone, end-to-end trainable model.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Knowledge-based question-answering system (KBQA) has demonstrated an ability to generate answers of natural language from information stored in a large-scale knowledge base. It has attracted a lot of attentions in the research areas of natural language processing and information retrieval. Generally, it complete the analysis challenge via three steps: identifying named entities, detecting predicates and generate SPARQL queries. In these three steps, predicate detection, a core component of this process, identifies the KB relation(s) a question refers to. To build a predicate detection structure, we identify all possible named entity first, then collect all predicates corresponding to the above entities. What follows is to calculate the similarity between problem and candidate predicates using a Multi-granularity neural network model(MGNN). To find the globally optimal entity-predicate assignment, we use a joint model which is based on the result of entity linking and predicate detection process rather than considering the local predictions (i.e. most possible entity or predicate) as the final result.</p>\n",

Entity linking is a process of ontology alignment or ontology mapping between source and target ontology. In this workflow, the goal is to detect similar concepts/classes or instances/individuals between the source and target ontology. There are two levels of linking, the first one is schema level linking and another one is instance level linking. Schema level linking is mapping/alignment between concepts/classes of the source and target ontology and on the other hand, instance level linking is mapping/alignment between instances/individuals of the source and target ontology.</p>\n<p>This proposal presents an approach for ontology alignment through the use of an unsupervised mixed neural network. In this workflow, we will explore reading and parsing the ontology and extracting all necessary information about concepts and instances, generating semantic vectors for each entity with different meta information like entity hierarchy, object property, data property, and restrictions and designing User Interface based system which will show all necessary information about the workflow.</p>\n",

This GUI would allow controlled data points selection, massive rendering, data display, custom interaction, selection of fields for plotting and layout of widgets in the browser using Intake, Xarray and Pyviz collection of tools. Currently majority of geospatial data exploration happens in stand-alone applications like Panoply and NcView, tools that have limited functionality, do not provide complex analysis methods and can only be reasonably extended by the software developers on those projects. This new tool, written in Python, but presented as a dashboard in the notebook environment, will be extendable directly by researchers by using it in conjunction with tools like Dask and will also provide complex analysis methods on the data being visualized. It holds the promise of saving Earth Science and other researchers significant amounts of time since they can directly focus on visual data analysis and research rather than writing custom code to explore data.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Rain and fog are very common weather in actual life. However, it can affect the visibility. Especially in heavy rain, rain streaks from various directions accumulate and make the background scene misty, which will seriously influence the accuracy of many computer vision systems, including video surveillance, object detection and tracking in autonomous driving, etc. Therefore, it is an important task to remove the rain and fog, and recover the background from rain images. It can be used for image and video processing to make them clearer and it can be a preprocessing method for many computer vision systems. We propose to implement this technology in FFmpeg. For video, this proposal proposes to utilize the relationship between frames to remove rain and fog. For single image, we can use traditional methods, such as discriminative sparse coding, low rank representation and the Gaussian mixture model. And also some deep learning methods.</p>\n",

Firstly, the project needs the development of the program modes in the Android application so that the user can select between the formers and get to launch the application and receive output/feedback accordingly. Then comes the development of the Audio and Visual Feedback features for the application. Now while developing these features it needs to get all the bases covered by coding all the possible classes (java files) and function modules for handling the background processes which can be achieved by taking some inspiration from the Neurophlex project. Animations need to be integrated and the app shall need UX/UI improvements for a better in-app experience. Details of the development process are further in my proposal.</p>\n",

Being a NodeJS powered framework specifically designed to create desktop apps, Electron happens to be the right choice for the job. While shifting to Electron, we will re-implement the existing functional / broken features ( all the tools available in PSLab desktop are not functioning as of now, which I have verified using a physical hardware ), redesign the UI /  UX flow, and take a more modular approach for development. At the core of the app, we will still use the PSLab-python library for device communication. As Electron apps are developed using JS, we can expect a more enthusiastic developer crowd to join the cause. A much more thorough documentation for the same is also available. Making use of Electron will also allow us to cherry pick modern looking UI libraries to give our user base a much more fluid experience. Finally I would make use of the easy to use packaging system of Electron so that users can easily install PSLab desktop with a single click instead of using the current install scripts.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Machine Translation is one of the most essential tasks of Natural Language Processing where a lot of research has been done. There are various metrics that are available to evaluate the quality of translation but most are obtained by computing the similarity between an MT hypothesis and a reference translation based on character N-grams or word N-grams. Using the data generated from the annotation of the TED Talk in two or more languages, as well as the relations between frames given in the Berkeley FrameNet Data Release 1.7, our task for this project is to build an automated metric system for machine translation, which is intended to measure the frame distance between sentence pairs in two languages. In this proposal, the task has been modelled as a regression task of predicting accuracy scores. The frames evoked and the related frame network has been used as pivotal features of the model.</p>\n",

Currently the connection between a client node and the gateway are established via IPIP (IPv4/6 over IPv6), which is unencrypted and therefore possibly readable by attackers. As mesh networks usually operate on unencrypted wireless connections, the attack vector is considerably big.</p>\n<p>Our solution is to combine the current cryptographic stack of BMX7 with the one used by WireGuard. The process via which this will be achieved will be iterative; meaning that first binary calls from bmx7 to userland WG will be introduced, afterwards the efforts will be centered in the creation of a new plugin implementing WireGuard routing by using part of the existing cryptographic primitives and at last the effort to combine the tunnel plugin with the wg one.</p>\n<p>The detail that distinguishes our approach’s difficulty from hard to medium is cryptographic keys. It’s simpler to announce new public keys for WireGuard and have a separate plugin than replacing the existing BMX7 keys to allow signing of descriptive updates and encryption of traffic.</p>\n",

Understanding the significance of this RNA world is one of the most important challenges faced in biology today, and the lncRNAs within it represent a gold mine of potential new biomarkers and drug targets. Its discovery is still at a preliminary stage.\nTo date, very few lncRNAs have been characterized in detail. However, it is clear that lncRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, and lncRNAs are thought to have a wide range of functions in cellular and developmental processes. There are many specialized lncRNA databases (like RefSeq, GENCODE, Ensembl, SGD, tair). We will use Machine Learning techniques to highlight and compare two sets of calls (of Ensembl / GENCODE and RefSeq) and determine which calls are incorrect.\nGoal of the Project: Implement a machine learning model (a 2nd pass filter) which will predict / validate credible calls (true positive/false positive cases) produced by RefSeq and GENCODE (or Ensembl).</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>There are numerous MPI implementations in the Gentoo portage tree and far more in general, but most of them can't be installed together as is. The only way to do this now is by using empi from the science overlay and empi has its shortcomings such as lack of multilib support and was not ported to the main tree. In my proposed plan, a new MPI framework ported from existing MPI applications is introduced to enable Gentoo to use multiple MPI versions and relevant packages depending on them (for example, HPL). The new MPI framework is mainly based on ‘Modules’ package together with Gentoo Prefix technique for detecting, choosing or manipulating MPI environment. Also, a new implementation of mpi.eclass is introduced and the packages can still be emerged normally onto the system without any trace of mpi.eclass being used. The approach also enables users to easily work with different implementations at the same time without any special privileges. In order to solve the defect that empi does not support multilib, the new framework also adds support for allowing the environment to be configured and installed into different places among different architectures (amd64, x86 etc.).</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Currently, the Google-Backend for GVfs supports only a subset of operations allowed by Google-Drive on the web-interface. The major problem with supporting all the operations is because of the difference in how POSIX systems handle files whereas how a database-backed system like Google-Drive handles files. This difference results into limitations as to what operations can be performed with the current libgdata API. Since, each file’s identifier is its ID, i.e. “name” equals ID, we have to specifically use “display-name” for storing a file’s title, which is what is shown by nautilus.</p>\n<p>Simply copying/moving files from one folder to other folder results into an error “Operation not supported” so as to preserve the file’s title. Copying/Moving is one of the fundamental operations that should be possible on a file.

Right now in BeiDou signals, GNSS-SDR fully supports BeiDou B1l and BeiDou B3I.\nThe primary goal of this project is to make the software receiver compatible with the BEIDOU B1C signals. This project will enhance the software receiver to aid acquisition and tracking of BEIDOU B1C signals that would further expand the receiver's capabilities and would facilitate research on multi-constellation, multi-frequency receiver working with real signals. The demodulation of the B-CNAV1 navigation message of BEIDOU B1C will open the door to innovation in multi-constellation receivers.\nAlong with the fully functional implementation of a GNSS receiver working with BEIDOU B1C signals, this project will help to address topics such as integrity, reliability, robustness, enhanced coverage, and high-accuracy positioning. Additionally, the integration of BEIDOU B1C observables into the position, velocity, time (PVT) solutions will allow the achievement in a diverse range of applications and components.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Carrier synchronization in standard, mass-market GNSS receivers typically utilizes well understood locked-loop architectures. The performance obtained with such architectures is sufficient for benign propagation scenarios, but typically deliver poor performance under harsh propagation conditions. Code and carrier tracking, as well as joint code/carrier synchronization, can be formulated as an estimation problem which can be solved using Bayesian filtering methods. It has been shown in the GNSS literature that KF-based synchronization solutions can be used to overcome the performance limitations of standard approaches, offering implicitly adaptive filter bandwidth, and opening up the possibility of using nonlinear models to avoid certain limitations associated with the use of code, phase or frequency discriminators. In this contribution, we will leverage powerful nonlinear tracking algorithms, including cubature, unscented, and sigma point Kalman filters in order to produce realizations of carrier and joint code-carrier tracking blocks which promise to be more effective and adaptable in challenging GNSS environments when compared to traditional architectures.</p>\n",

However, structuring and comparing new architectures is non-trivial.

The explored class admits a canonical traversable structure which allows common neural network constructs, and shows the literal correspondence between higher-order functions and some architectures. We also show our toolkit is compatible with monadic computations necessary for training and evaluation. Our methods allow for expressive, unified, and elegant constructions.</p>\n",

Publication of biological data is often weakly structured and has no standardised format making assimilation challenging. Currently PyOpenWorm acts as a quick data access layer for researchers to query C. elegans anatomy and physiology. It currently incorporates data from the primary literature, WormAtlas and WormBase. This project would aim to expand the data available for model validation and for query in PyOpenWorm. Expanding the data available would aid hypothesis generation in the C.elegans research community, by allowing fast access to past observations and by facilitating the generation of more robust models through model validation tests such as SciUnit. However, ultimately it could also be a poster child to inspire an increase in standardisation and statistical accountability in the publication of biological research as a whole.

So, to allow developers to easily develop tools (any type of tool, visualisation, tables or anything that can be integrated on the gene / protein report page) for BlueGenes (the new interface), Intermine released a BlueGenes Tool API which defines specifications on how to build BlueGene compatible tool in JavaScript. Currently there exists two such tools - protovista and cytoscape-interaction-network-viewer. The BlueGenes ClojureScript application actually queries for all tools available before sending the report page to frontend and integrates the ones found. These tools are actually javascript applications following the specifications provided by the BlueGenes tool API and receive some initialisation input from BlueGenes like gene id in case of a gene report page.\nThe purpose of this project is to develop BlueGenes compatible visualisation tools which can help biologists and explorers have better insights via the report of a gene / protein on the report page.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The Wayback Machine archives billions of webpages, with vast numbers being added to the collection every day, including news sources. Though the crawling operations are quite successful, there is still work to be done to improve the quality of webpages archived by checking for “broken” or “bad” pages. I propose developing a methodology to assess the quality of news sources, both in terms of bias/factual reporting and in terms of technical viability such as geoblocking, paywall blocks, and CAPTCHAs. I will then use this methodology to create a tool that can automatically assess quality and take an appropriate action, perhaps preserving an error message and reason for failure in the Wayback Machine. This tool will ideally be integrated with the Wayback Machine’s web crawlers. I will also use my findings to develop recommendations for circumvention tactics, such as paying for subscriptions to important news sources or negotiating agreements with CAPTCHA services to allow the Internet Archive, as a public good, to bypass the CAPTCHA. The goal of the project is to develop a system to think about the quality of archived webpages and then create tools to automate quality assessment.</p>\n",

In the current implementation of KDE Partition Manager, all the privileged tasks such as executing some external program like btrfs, sfdisk etc. Or copying a block of data from one partition to the other, which requires escalated permissions to execute are executed by a helper non GUI application. So, instead of running whole GUI application (KDE Partition Manager) as root or superuser, a helper non GUI application is spawned which runs as root and executes privileged tasks. This helper program communicates with KDE Partition Manager over simple DBus protocol. The current implementation may seem a good idea, but is not, the reason being that KAuth is an extra layer added over Polkit-qt which causes extra overhead.\n So, the proposal for this project is to port all the authentication/authorization code from KAuth to Polkit-qt without effecting the original behaviour of KDE Partition Manager.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>The Plasma desktop does not have a hard dependency on any login manager, but the SDDM (Simple Desktop Display Manager) login manager is the recommended option. SDDM used in conjunction with Plasma, however, results in certain issues, some of which fall under the guise of consistency between the login screen and the desktop. In practice this means that as soon as there is any relevant veering from Plasma defaults, the login manager no longer provides an identical visual experience. This GSoC project would try to solve that very issue by adding the possibility of syncing the desktop and login manager options. Options that could be synced are: color scheme, font, font size, font rendering, icon theme (obtained from the Plasma theme). Rather than adding discrete options, the suggestion is to have only one option that would pertain to syncing SDDM settings with a particular user’s settings. Patching SDDM to support Plasma wallpapers would also fall within the scope of the project. Most importantly, because desktop display scaling preferences are likewise not respected in SDDM, the project would also tackle the issue of allowing users to set a display scaling preference via GUI.</p>\n",

However, KIO-unaware applications are unable to interact seamlessly with KIO Slaves. For example, editing a file in gdrive:/ in LibreOffice will not save changes to your Google Drive. One potential solution is to make use of FUSE, which is an interface provided by the Linux kernel, which allows userspace processes to provide a filesystem which can be mounted and accessed by regular applications. KIOFuse is a project by Fabian Vogt that allows the possibility to mount KIO filesystems in the local system; therefore exposing them to POSIX-compliant applications such as Firefox and LibreOffice.

In digiKam, tags on photos are strongly supported for the sake of providing users with a natural workflow of searching and arranging photos in their collections. Since many of our photos contain faces, face tag has apparently emerged as an essential property for any photos management software, also with the fact that user has to tag thousand of their photos manually. Being aware of that, digiKam team has put a lot of efforts to develop face engine, capable of scanning photos and suggesting face tags automatically basing on pre-tagged photos by users. However, that functionality is currently deactivated in digiKam, as it is slow while not adequately accurate.

As of today, there are still a lot of API functions not implemented by the test driver. The goal of this project is to expand the API coverage of the test libvirt driver.</p>\n",

First of all, each algorithm is very similar but implemented separately. If we extend these implementations to infer other attributes, there would be a lot of code duplication and it is hard to maintain consistency. Therefore, it is better to replace them with a more designed implementation. We have a new framework for deducing attribute called “Attributor” developed by Johannes Doerfert.

This is true both in standard compilation but also link-time-optimization (LTO) in which the module is (partially) merged with others in the same project at link time. LTO is able to take advantage of this to optimize functions calls to outside the translation unit. Code compiled without LTO for all of its dependencies, however, does not have this information and therefore is unable to perform such optimizations. To remedy this issue, one might propose always compiling programs with LTO enabled. This doesn’t solve the problem for two reasons of practicality: LTO comes with a nontrivial compile-time investment; and many libraries upon which a program could depend, do not ship with LTO information, simply headers and binaries. In this project, we propose solving the problem by generating annotated versions of the source code that also include this derived information. Such an approach has the benefits of both worlds: allowing optimizations previously limited to LTO without running LTO and only providing headers.</p>\n",

However, it can contain either too little or too much information.</p>\n<p>In my proposed project, I indent to use static backward program slicing to enhance bug report generation. Instead of doing a fix-point algorithm on the control flow graph (CFG) though, my solution would be implemented on the abstract syntax tree (AST). This solution would only be an estimation, so I only propose to add more information to the bug reports, and research whether program slicing could be used for bug path shortening as a followup work.</p>\n",

Currently, a build can be started only when patches are committed to the master branch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has led to some major setbacks with respect to developer productivity. MacPorts also needs some custom views in buildbot to be able to better analyze build history, commits, etc. The legacy version doesn’t allow us to write such custom views.

This enables LibRoadrunner to simulate models on par with compiled C/C++ code. By combining Libroadrunner with standard optimization algorithms it is possible to use Libroadrunner to fit models to data. At present this is done by writing code to link the standard Python optimizer available via scipy with Libroadrunner. Although this works, it is inefficient and for large models, it is not practical. In this project, we would like to develop a C/C++ based differential evolution plugin that can be used directly by Libroadrunner (after integrating it with RRPlugins) without having to go via Python.

Model comparison is not trivial because of the different structures and number of parameters of each model. Fortunately, there are some information criteria (i.e. leave-one-out cross-validation) that can be used for this task.

Intuitively, this doesn’t represent a genome but rather a consensus. A workaround used today  is holding variation data in VCF files that don’t update the reference meaning the reference will always represent the genome as it <strong>was</strong> not as it <strong>is</strong> or as it’s <strong>evolving</strong>. It’s clear that the current method of representing genomes is not ideal.\nThere is a need for a representing the reference in a data structure that contains its inherent variation. Different methods have been tried and the variant graph is a promising one. The way the graph works is by representing the variation within the genome as alternative paths one can traverse the graph through and conserved regions as nodes without alternative paths to the get to the next node; we then index the nodes for querying and alignment.\nMoreover, variation graphs hold an advantage with rapidly evolving genomes and short read data that could get thrown out when it doesn’t have a place to align to in the reference; with the variant graph short reads should reads could align to alternative nodes.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Molecular docking—the prediction of binding modes and binding affinity of a molecule to a target of known structure—is a great computational tool for structure-based drug design. However, docking scoring functions are mostly empirical or knowledge-based and the flexibility of the receptor is completely neglected in most docking studies. Recent advances in the field showed that scoring functions can be effectively learnt by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Here we want to build on top of these findings and develop a CNN scoring function for flexible docking by extending the capabilities of <em>gnina</em>—a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for molecular docking—and by building an high-quality training dataset for flexible docking.</p>\n",

WASM now support multi-threading with Web Worker and shareArrayBuffer, and is going on supporting new v128 value types used for SIMD, which can both improve the parallel computing capability on Web.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the main goal of this project is to speedup OpenCV.js by multi-threading and SIMD.</p>\n",

However OpenCV's model zoo needs some new additions. Models that have acquired State-of-the-art (SOTA) in different computer vision tasks are somewhat lacking in the model family that is currently listed in the OpenCV repository. This gives rise to the necessity of adding new, powerful models to the list. The goal of this project is to curate more models for ease of use by the OpenCV DNN module and put them in a place where they can be easily accessed such as LFS on Git.  The proposed project will add six (potentially nine) new models to the OpenCV Model Zoo. \nAll of the selected models have, either state-of-the-art results in the task they perform or belong to a task category not currently present in the model zoo (e.g. Image Generation). The proposed workflow and the established timeline take into account worst-case scenarios, guaranteeing the project's completion and minimizing risks.</p>\n",

It’s goal is to create an up-sampled copy that is as detailed and visually pleasing as possible. It is used in a wide range of fields, such as medical image processing or surveillance camera stream processing. Using deep learning models for super resolution is a widely researched area, as they generally achieve better accuracy than classical computer vision based algorithms. There are many popular type of models used, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning methods. I propose to implement two deep learning based models to be a part of the OpenCV library. One is EDSR, which is a residual network based model, and is known for it’s high accuracy. The other one is LapSRN, which is a fast, but still accurate model, that can be deployed to real-time applications. So integrating these two OpenCV would obtain a model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and another one that can be deployed on devices that have lower computational power, while still maintaining high accuracy.</p>\n",

The Wikidata project contains structured data about items, and statements about the relationships between items. In recent years, OpenStreetMap has gained a large number of Wikidata tags, and the information from the Wikidata database should improve the importance rankings and search results from Nominatim. To accomplish this objective, it will be necessary to create a script that can process a Wikidata dump and extract the information that would be useful to Nominatim, then import the data it into the Nominatim database. Nominatim already uses Wikipedia links to improve search results, and where Wikidata is available it can help determine the correct Wikipedia link that should be used whenever a Wikipedia link does not exist for an OSM object. This can be done both by directly matching objects to their Wikipedia links via Wikidata, and also by ensuring that links are made to the correct type of object and that links are not made to vague pages such as those that describe brands or other information that is not relevant to search result ranking.</p>\n",

The reason these two projects are linked is because one prerequisite for a safe migration is to have full test coverage, so it's important to make sure that the backend coverage is 100% before migrating.The project would  then make sure that all libraries Oppia uses are compatible with python 3. This project would also standardize all scripts in the codebase to be written in Python (currently, there is a mixture of bash and Python being used).

Currently ELI5 supports scikit-learn, xgboost, and other ML libraries, taking in estimators such as linear classifiers and decision trees.

          "description": "<p>A recent addition to the local statistical models in PySAL is the implementation of Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) model, a multiscale extension to the widely used approach for modeling process spatial heterogeneity - Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The GWR model in PySAL can currently estimate Gaussian, Poisson and Logistic models though the MGWR model is currently limited to only Gaussian models. This project aims to expand the MGWR model to nonlinear local spatial regression modeling techniques where the response outcomes may be discrete (following a Poisson distribution) or binary (Logistic models). Subsequently, to support efficient testing for different model implementations, a simulated data generator module will be implemented to supply test datasets following unique model variable distribution needs. This will also provide a foundation for possible expansion to test other local model implementations in PySAL. Additionally, since the functionality to predict the dependent variable at unsampled locations is not supported for the MGWR model in PySAL, this project also aims to enable predictions for MGWR.</p>\n",

The package volesti is a c++ software with an R interface being the first package providing such a variety of options in geometric statistics. It currently scales to a few hundreds dimensions and hence it could be an essential tool for a quite large number of scientific applications. However, the possibility to scale from a few hundred to a few thousand dimensions was considered as a very far-reaching goal for many years. The goal of this project is to provide the first ever implementations for sampling from convex polytopes and volume computation in a few thousand dimensions. We exploit some very recent theoretical results that guarantee fast convergence and numerical stability in order to propose an efficient implementation of the current state-of-the-art geometrical random walk algorithms. The proposed implementations will be a decisive contribution to other scientific fields as computational geometry, finance and optimization.

Currently, this methods are used widely and their applications include disease risk mapping, climate change risk predictions, conservation biology, among others. Physiological data suggests that Grinnellian niches are convex in nature and they may probably have an ellipsoidal form when multiple dimensions are considered. However, among the available software in the field, algorithms to model ecological niches as ellipsoids in the environmental space are scarce. Several analyses, not currently available, can be performed assuming ellipsoidal niches, especially if recent  literature is considered.

The first objective is to update the annotation system for Red Hen’s NewsScape dataset to FrameNet 1.7 using Open-Sesame and Semafor parsers. The second objective is to expand the lexical units, frames and frame-to-frame relations in FrameNet 1.7 through a knowledge-driven approach and a distributional semantics approach. The knowledge-driven approach uses BabelNet to induce the frames of unrecognized lexical units in the tagged NewsScape dataset. The latter distributional semantics approach uses Deep Structured Semantic Models (DSSM) to create word embeddings of lexical units (LUs) to resolve the inconsistency in FrameNet hierarchy, tag LUs with their missing frames, and locate new frames using SemCor corpus. If time permits, DSSM is used to expand the frame-to-frame relations with Entity and Event frames using ACE 2005 Entities and Events dataset.</p>\n",

My proposal to this idea is to implement examples of collective behaviors using swarm robotics strategies in new or old scenarios of the RoboComp RCIS simulator, like collective exploration of the scenario, patterns formation, morphogenesis or another collective activities.

          "description": "<p>My proposal aims to create a new component that allows to store the representation of the robot’s world over time, as well as query it. For this, it is necessary to store the graph structure used to represent the knowledge of the world that the robot possesses. In RoboComp, when robots need to perform complex tasks, its behaviour is based on missions. The mission begin from an initial state and through different transitions reaches a final state, that is, the robot completes the mission. The states are represented by a graph. \nMy proposal is to use a JSON structure to store this graph. This allows its storage as a collection of documents in MongoDB. Consequently, each document could represent a state of the robot. Also, this slot is intended to study the viability of Neo4J for this purpose, as far as I am concerned, the best option would be to use the polyglot persistence, that consists in to use the database best suited for the type of data, in our case MongoDB, and in to use the database best suited for the type of queries, in our case Neo4j. Specifically I think that Neo4j Doc Manager could be our best choice.</p>\n",

Rocket.chat itself is the repository for much of that content but the rest typically resides in other applications such as github or jira or google docs, many of which are third party services and so the content is not owned by the community that hosts the Rocket.chat server. In one particular scenario, a user may want to write an article and “publish” it to groups or contacts within Rocket.chat. Today that would have to be done typically using a third party service. What if instead article creation, searching, and storage were integrated with Rocket.chat such that each user could maintain his or her own library of articles and contacts of that user could subscribe to see new articles posted by that user and to discuss those articles using something like Rocket.chat Threads.</p>\n",

As combinatorialists are using RSK  and its generalizations in their research, as well as continuing to develop even more variations, having an extensible class structure and new algorithms from recent research implemented in SageMath will increase SageMath's utility.</p>\n",

Even when users are interested in a handful of syscalls, strace will intercept all syscall made by the observed processes, involving several context switches per syscall.</p>\n<p>Since Linux 3.5, userspace applications can rely on seccomp-bpf to filter the syscalls they want to trace. In that case, the set of monitored syscalls is filtered in the kernel, using cBPF, before any context switch to userspace. strace could leverage seccomp-bpf to avoid tracing syscalls users don't want.\nThe tracing landscape of Linux also drastically evolved in recent years. In particular, user applications can rely on eBPF programs to filter and aggregate data of interest in the kernel, with low overhead.</p>\n<p>During this Google Summer of Code, I will finish and merge the works started to 1) rely on seccomp-bpf to filter syscalls in kernel space and 2) allow strace to use alternative backends.

SymPy already has the features of generating source code for other languages from SymPy syntax. This would allow SymPy to easily read in, alter, and write out computational code. Sympy can easily be implemented in other programs as a computing engine because it's fast as compared to many other libraries and languages for computation. \nThe other objective of this project is to improve Lfortran and implement it as an interactive computational environment in Fortran and a library with an effective API in Python. It also increases the usability of Lfortran.

No preprocessing is necessary from the user side. Each dataset is implemented as a subclass of DatasetBuilder which handles the dataset appropriately.

Thus, easy environments for reinforcement learning agents are those with dense reward signals. In these environments, most algorithms included in TF-Agents already achieve good results. However, in sparse-reward environments such as Montezuma’s Revenge from Atari 2600, such algorithms fail to discover optimal behavior as it rarely finds any nonzero reward. To mitigate this problem, multiple methods have been proposed to add intrinsic rewards or “curiosity” to existing algorithms to extend the capability of these algorithms.</p>\n<p>This project will implement three curiosity modules to TF-Agents: pseudocount-based exploration via Context Tree Switching (CTS), Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and Random Network Distillation (RND). These modules will be implemented as modules so that they can be enabled or disabled in one line for existing reinforcement learning algorithms in TF-Agents. With the addition of these modules, the users will be able to gain meaningful results without careful reward shaping on sparse-reward environments.</p>\n",

As a later step, the deployment could be upgraded to work with Helm or KNative.</p>\n<p>Through this project, OODT will gain the ability to seamlessly manage OODT components regardless of the deployment environment. Technologies including Docker, Kubernetes and Maven will be required to carry out this project.</p>\n",

Motivated by the potential impact of APR, in this project, we propose to build a repair framework that improves upon on past successful work VFix and S3.</p>\n<p>In this project, we aim to fix NPE bugs. We will use data flow analysis as proposed in VFix to accurately localize buggy code fragments in program under repair. We then use S3 to semantically reason about the identified buggy code fragments via dynamic symbolic execution on test cases. However, simply relying on test cases may not be sufficient. We thus plan to further enhance the semantic reasoning in S3 with the ability to leverage user-provided annotations. After this step, we obtain a set of constraints that constitutes specifications of the program. We then propose a program synthesis technique that improve the template-based repair in VFix and syntax-guided synthesis in S3 to synthesize repairs.</p>\n",

It is an essential task in many biological studies today, including population and medical studies. The initial stages of de-novo assembly require the construction of a de-bruijn graph (DBG) from sequencing reads, the compression of a de-bruijn graph into a unitig graph, and the compression of multiple unitigs and nodes into contigs, supported by evidence from mapping paired-end reads. A coherent ecosystem of computational tools and packages allow researchers to quickly implement and test their ideas. For bioinformatics, Julia already offers such an ecosystem in the form of the BioJulia &amp; EcoJulia projects, and additional independent packages.\nThis project will add sequence assembly tools to the BioJulia ecosystem, specifically: 1) DBG construction from reads, 2) UG construction from a DBG and 3) Constructing contigs using unitigs.

This also affected cups-filters as a whole, because it was unable to build.

          "description": "<p>In recent years, ns-3 has been widely used for the simulation of wireless networks, because it features several built-in and external modules implementing different wireless technologies. The overall performance of this kind of networks are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the signal propagation through the wireless link, thereby, a proper modeling of the channel behavior is of primary importance to obtain reliable results from the simulations. This project aims to tackle this issue by proposing an extension of the spectrum module to model both frequency and spatial-dependent phenomena, and to account for the directional behavior of the signal propagation. This will be achieved by implementing the modeling framework described in 3GPP TR 38.901, which includes the statistical characterization of different propagation environments, supports the modeling of multi-antenna systems, and, thanks to its modularity, can be easily extended with new environments or other additional features. Even if it has been specifically designed for the simulation of cellular networks, it supports frequency bands between 0.5 and 100 GHz, thus can be used even for other wireless technologies.</p>\n",

Following the increasing use of\ncontainers, one of Tungsten Fabric's use case involves integrating its virtual networking stack with the Kubernetes framework to provide a range of multi-tenant networking features.

However, the data on the Xena is not updated. Current Xena data was updated on release 10, roughly 1.5 yrs ago.

For this 2nd use, the interface could be improved quite a bit: right now the UI is just some text inputs, with no autocompletion, no validation, no additional, format-based inputs, and in general no help to the user. The project aims to provide a much more user-friendly interface, using autocompletion, dropdowns, and/or other form elements, so that users didn't have to, for example, guess what tables and fields exist on the wiki.</p>\n",
