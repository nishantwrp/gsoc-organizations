This library is used in a lot of interesting projects such as terrainServer and worldviz. Currently, the terrainServer offers Web-based services providing perspective terrain views. The idea of this project is to extend Terrain model generation and analysis to practical scenarios, where it would be desirable to have Web-based access to analysis tools (e.g., difference surfaces, mass calculations, inclination analysis) and to model generation functions, using the Triturus library. In the Google Summer of Code program, we shall try to achieve Web-based access for few of these tools. This module will be named ‘terrainTools’ and will be a standalone project.</p>\n",

The motivation of this project is to build a Standalone Track Analysis page in JavaScript(AngularJS) that could also serve as the starting point for the next generation website of the EnviroCar project. The current website implementation is in PHP and the intention is to implement it with AngularJS to allow for more flexibility while analyzing single track performance and also additional features like comparative track analysis. The above goal will be pursued with the help of LeafletJS, HighCharts, OpenCPU or ShinyApps. I have also proposed to add a framework to allow for incorporating a Rating's page that allows the user to compare his/her performance with average expected performance from a similar vehicle.</p>\n",

This makes Rogas a more general framework that covers a broader range of network analytics applications.

As a proof of concept, the extensions created in this project will be tested using MD trajectory data collected from simulations of a small molecule and standard MD analysis techniques. While this project will be tested using a MD workflow, the result will be extensible to other scientific and big data workflows.</p>\n",

After switching to handwritten serializers, the number of samples in java.lang.reflect, org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.runtime, and sun.reflect was reduced to 36% from 54%. The majority of the rest of the calls to java.lang.reflect are from the comparators. The number of garbage collections was also significantly reduced. Similarly, by adding handwritten serializer to the POJO word count example could reduce the runtime from 9.5s to 8s on a 100mb input file.

          "description": "<p>Many applications require mechanisms for high speed, real time and continuous data acquisition from a sensor that is essentially an ADC. Most hobbyists would want to use simple devices, rather than high end converters with differential serial interfaces to communicate as these high end devices can be expensive. The typical serial data communication protocols used for this are somewhat limited in terms of speed, while parallel data communication definitely has an advantage of higher speed data transfers.</p>\n<p>This GSoC project aims to utilize the two PRUs present in the PRUSS2 subsystem and their low latency architecture to get a fast, generic, parallel analog converter interface, in the form of parallel bus, ready for various applications. The project will provide a ready to use firmware, user-space library, kernel driver, and the subsystem to manage all the parallel data transactions. This will further allow developers to build some cool applications like function generators, oscilloscopes, voltmeter etc.</p>\n",

Hence the motivation for exposing the PRU as an I2C,SPI,UART device comes from the fact that they would be no software overheads in doing it and hence,we would gain extra serial interfaces without wasting valuable CPU cycles in bitabanging.</p>\n<p>This project involves writing Device Tree Overlays,Device Drivers and PRU firmware code for Bitbanging I2C,SPI and UART.</p>\n",

Most people today do not realise that when you undergo an MRI, CT, Xray or other medical imaging procedure, the health record belongs to you and you can ask for a copy of the result. It is a good idea to keep a personal collection of the medical scans because they are useful when you seek second opinion or when you move and visit a new clinic. Also, in the case of new injuries or emergencies, having easy access to prior scans is very helpful, and sometimes even critical.</p>\n<p>Bonestagram provides a fun, interactive visualisation on the web for medical scans. Users will be able to see their medical scans in the browser, and interact with the visualisation through the web cam.</p>\n<p>Bonestagram is Javascript-based and the components created will be submitted to the mentoring organisation BioJS as building blocks for visualisation of biological data on the web.</p>\n<p>For a preview of the development progress, please feel free to check out this video (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWDkqoFHr_g\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWDkqoFHr_g</a>).</p>\n",

For example, it could be interesting to calculate the abundance (by area) of regions like angiogenesis, necrosis, and infiltrating lymphocytes to infer patient-level characteristics.\n    A tissue slide can easily reach around 20GB in-memory, which turns intractable many approaches of feeding those slides entirely to a classifier. One recent method for addressing this problem is sampling regions based on low-resolution features (i.e. texture, boundaries) for extracting information about the tissue. Moreover, this method can also help with speeding up the processing, since after cropping the proposed regions, the problem would be turned into a tractable learning problem.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>In Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) system, the modeling process is usually represented as boolean operations of some basic primitives such as cubes, spheres, etc. This method is often used in solid modeling system and its operations always construct the basic solid modeling pipeline.\n    Besides, the boundary representation (B-rep) is also a method for representing models by using a collection a connected surface elements. So for the purpose of solid modeling, it is commonly impractical to represent these thin solids exactly as bounded volume, thus an available approach is to assign an implicit thickness to each face and then we can consider the thickness as a face property. Simply speaking, when shooting a ray towards the B-rep model, we can get ‘in’ and ‘out’ hit point from a face while the ‘out’ hit point is a small offset from the ‘in’ one with given thickness value along the ray direction.</p>\n",

Defects in meshes occur when we import from one file format to another file format (here .g being the native format). They might also occur due to imprecise arithmetic, modelling transformations, designers’ fault, programming bugs, etc. Some of these are inevitable. Thus we require some programmatic method to heal meshes which are defective. There are quite a few features already present to heal meshes, but these are not sufficient. Hence, the project. Existing features include: removal of unused and exactly duplicate vertices, dangling edges, decimation of edges, and fusing of equivalent faces. The features that will added are: checking manifold connectivity, removal of gaps, T - joints, overlaps, large holes, and degenerate triangles.</p>\n",

Building a web service to provide protein alignments between ensembl and PDB sequences will help mapping mutations to protein 3D structures. Building an auto updating pipeline will help cBioPortal kept adopting the updated protein structures, and advance the cancer research eventually. The project starts from downloading human proteins in all isoforms from ensembl and blast them against all PDB sequences. The alignments will be parsed and stored into carefully designed databases. A JSON based API will be built upon the database via predefined methods in database query, and cBioPortal obtained the alignments from the exposed API. A pipeline will also be constructed to update the alignments weekly. Once new structures from PDB were released, the pipeline initiate automatically to update the alignments on the updated structures. The updated alignments were stored into the database and a regression test was applied to check the correctness on a validation set. Performance, robustness, reliability and developing feasibility were all considered in the proposal.</p>\n",

Currently, cBioPortal has a multitude of information on DNA and RNA, but their information on protein levels derives from protein arrays, a technology that has severe limitations relative to mass spectrometry. Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has performed mass spectrometry on the patient samples for TCGA tumors and it also includes information on post-translational modifications. I propose to integrate this information with the cBioPortal visualization interface. This involves extending their database with protein abundances and PTMs based on the CPTAC data and updating the cBioPortal interface with a new tab for post-translational modifications and updating existing tabs to accommodate the new protein data. By providing this upgrade, a tool that helps both scientists and doctors see personal and population biology at a glance will gain a new dimension.</p>\n",

This will be achieved by integrating readily available GPU deep learning frameworks as back-ends into the current implementation. The targeted hardware are OpenCL capable devices as well as CUDA capable devices.

The project I would like to work on will be “Responsive Layout for Emails” that would include  making emails more reliable and readable over different devices by providing a simplified and responsive layouts for email. Considering the situation of current world, 50% of emails open occurs on mobile device and 70% of people delete emails instantly which do not timely render. The main aim of the project would be to let people read emails sent through CiviCRM properly on all of their devices.\nAlso, I would like to propose a more systematic and consistent email mechanism for system generated emails.

          "description": "<p>Lemmatization is a core preprocessing task for NLP which allows for meaningful comparisons of different forms of a given word in a corpus. For highly inflected languages like Latin and Greek, the task is particularly important for two reasons: 1. words often have a dozen or more possible forms (and, as opposed to go in English, this is the norm and not only a characteristic of irregularly formed words), and 2. small corpus size in general often demands that counts for a given feature like words be based on the broadest measure possible. Currently available Latin lemmatizers rely largely on dictionary-based look up methods, which is a good solution for frequently occurring and unambiguous forms. For my Google Summer of Code project, I propose to rewrite the CLTK Latin and Greek lemmatizers to handle a higher percentage of forms by applying a backoff tagging approach.</p>\n",

In recent years, discrete dynamic modeling has emerged as a powerful method of modeling and understanding biological systems. One type, boolean network models (which was initially used as a prototypical model of genetic regulatory networks), has been shown to be a tractable approach for modeling large-systems. A boolean network consists of a set of nodes whose state is binary and is determined only by other nodes in the network through Boolean functions. The simplicity and self-containment of these graphs makes it extremely fast to simulate these systems and is also a very realistic interpretation of how biological networks actually work. Unfortunately, no libraries yet exist for converting a visualization of a biological network into a logic gate visualization and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Thus, the aim of this GSoC project is to develop a web-based tool that can visualize biological networks, and also transform these networks into a logic gate-based system.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>This is a brief overview of what I intend to do. I want to implement the standardized smart grid\nconnection ”OpenADR”. What are the advantages to implement this interface into the Colibri\nproject? The grid operators have the possibility to inform the customer about e.g. the current\nenergy price, with this standardized interface. The customer can control his electrical consumers\nregarding the given information. Colibri with the OpenADR connection helps to automate this\nprocess on the customer side. The Colibri control module can reduce or increase the total power\nconsumption depending on to the information from the other smart grid agents. In the end this\nwill result in a more stable grid, because the energy producer and consumer will stand in an\ninterdependency. This also leads to an better usage of the energy resources which is a great benefit\nfor the society. Therefore it is a good idea to add this functionality to the Colibri project.</p>\n",

In contrast to the standard acceptance-rejection method, Tinflex requires only knowledge of the probability density function, its first two derivatives and a partitioning in intervals with at most one inflection point and is thus easier to use.

The service provides two different types of search APIs,  namely, Keyword Search and Prefix Search. The lookup service currently returns the query results in XML (default) and JSON formats and works on English language. It is based on a Lucene Index providing a weighted label lookup, which combines string similarity with a relevance ranking in order to find the most relevant matches for a given label.  As a part of the GSOC 2016, I am going to implement an improvised Lucene search module by generating indexes from SPARQL end points and RDF dumps.

          "description": "<p>Writing and maintaining software is challenging. Software is complex and keeping it\nbug-free remains an unsolved problem. Debian Stretch, the next Debian stable release, comprises 850 million lines of software source code. Code written in the C programming language accounts for 41% of the lines, which is more than in any other programming language. Debile, Debian’s package analysis platform, so far includes the CppCheck, Clang Static Analyzer, and Coccinelle tools for packages with C, C++, and Objective-C code. However, all of the tools perform static analyses, which can result in false positives. Too many reported false positives hinder adoption of the tools. To address this issue, I propose to integrate the KLEE tool into Debile. KLEE performs dynamic analysis on C programs and reports only true positives, i.e. real bugs. It does so by systematically exploring as many as possible execution paths in a given program. Errors that KLEE reports exist only along feasible execution paths, i.e. they correspond to real bugs in the program.</p>\n",

Since I think that Local Translator is a very useful submodule, there are still lots of things missing. The tool was working in Drupal 7, but it was rather limited in functionality and by far not fulfilling expectations of professional translators. I believe the next goal is to make the Local Translator a professional CAT Tool and I would like to help with implementing CKEditor plugins using Javascript. Because TMGMT wants to use the CKEditor libraries to build an alternative non-WYSIWYG translation editor, I would propose to implement some special linguistic actions like defining segments, marking them in the UI and masking specific HTML tags.</p>\n",

This site is a shared responsibility between CommOps and the Infrastructure team. Unlike most applications in the Fedora infrastructure, the Community Blog is not based off Ansible playbooks. <a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ansible</a> is an open-source configuration management suite designed to make automation easier. Fedora already uses Ansible extensively across its infrastructure.</p>\n<p>My task would be migrating the Community Blog (and by extension, Fedora Magazine) to an Ansible-based set up and writing the documentation for any related SOPs.</p>\n<h3>The Why</h3>\n<p>In the current set up, the Community Blog and Fedora Magazine are managed separately from each other, and are managed by a single Infrastructure team member. By moving them to Ansible-based installations and merging the WordPress bases together, it adds the following benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easier for other Infrastructure team members to fix, maintain, or apply updates</li>\n<li>Automates by maintaining a single, Ansible-based WordPress install vs. two independent WordPress sites</li>\n<li>Creates a standard operating procedure for hosting blog platforms within Fedora (can be used for other extensions in the future)</li>\n</ol>\n",

High density of omnidirectional antennae per unit area directly translates to low SNR and thus bad wireless performance of our nodes. In the case where we only control one wireless node, not much can be done. We can scan the surroundings and choose the channel with a maximal SNR. But with a node database system, we can simultaneously optimize the spectrum allocation (both in terms of bandwidth as well as the center frequency, i.e. channel) across different nodes.

With these information each node of the network is able calculate the paths to reach any other destination. \nThese messages are periodically generated, based on the configuration parameter that regulates the sending interval. A short period will make the network react rapidly but it will also cause a large overhead due to control messages.\nPop Routing is a recent technique that takes advantage of the knowledge of the network topology to find the optimal value for the OONF’s timers. Using Pop Routing every node computes its own “betweenness centrality” and uses it to calculate the optimal trade-off between convergence and overhead. The  algorithm has been developed at the UniTN and the needed libraries to compute the BC are available as free software.\nMy goal is to build a daemon that can calculate autonomously the BC of the network, together with a plugin for OONF that will use this value to tune its timers.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Recent scientific advances have lead to a huge increase in the amount of available genomic sequence information. In the past this sequence information consisted of a single reference sequence, which can be relatively easily visualised in a linear way. Today we often know multiple variants of a particular DNA sequence. The differences between the individual sequences are called polymorphisms and can range in size from variations of a single base pair (single nucleotide polymorphism = SNP) to variations involving long stretches of DNA.</p>\n<p>There are a number of approaches (and file formats) for formally encoding variants of genomic sequences and their relationships in the form of graphs. Unfortunately it is often difficult to visualise these graphs in a way which conveys the complex information yet is intuitively easy to understand. The goal of this project is to help in the visualisation of genomic sequences and their variations by providing a JavaScript module which generates visual representations of genomic sequence graphs. This module aims to display the information about all sequence variants in a single visualisation as elegantly as possible.</p>\n",

Currently the eHive workflows are manually coded and this requires expertise in computer science. It also takes up a lot of time. Due to such shortcomings handling workflows becomes very cumbersome.</p>\n<p>This project aims to remove these drawbacks of the existing system by creating a graphical editor for eHive workflows using Google's Blockly library which would enable us to visualize the XML code in terms of Blockly blocks and provide output for them in XML format using Blockly's existing \"Export to XML\" option. The backbone of this graphical editor would be some rules written to handle the Relax NG XML schema specification and to create Blockly blocks automatically in accordance with the same.</p>\n<p>For example, the XML to Blockly converter would apply pre-defined rules to the Relax NG specification entered by the user, and generate code to represent the specification using Blockly blocks.</p>\n<p>The proposed editor would have capabilities of handling not just workflows for eHive, but any specifications written using the Relax NG schema.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Gentoo is an operating system with extreme focus on configurability and performance. To provide fully customizable experience, without interfering with the stability of the system, Gentoo has a concept of masked packages. These masked packages (or versions) are either untested, or are known to be unstable and are installed only if the user explicitly unmasks them. While this concept is a boon to the stability of the operating system, the current implementation requires the packages to be tested manually by a team of developers. This significantly increases the time in which new packages are made safely available to the users. The goal of this project is to provide a mechanism to test and stabilize the packages automatically with little or no human intervention.</p>\n",

This project will make it easier for users to create new styles and apply them to a list by providing them a web interface(as a part of Postorius) that will enable them to create new styles, edit/copy/inherit existing ones and apply them to a mailing list. For example, if a user wants to change whether Mailman sends a message to the unsubscriber when he/she leaves the mailing list, then, he would just change the 'send_goodbye_message' attribute in the style being used by that particular list and all done!!! The web interface will help the administrators in managing the styles with just a few click without having them to type long commands at shell. This will enhance the overall user experience.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>With the adoption of stricter email authentication policies to curb spam, intermediate mail handlers like mailing lists suffer potential problems of getting their mails flagged as spam and returning undelivered. The solution for this lies in the recently drafted IETF ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) protocol. From Mailman's point of view, ARC is a protocol that can help mitigate denial of service to subscribed addresses at Yahoo!, AOL, and other sites that have a <code>p = reject</code> DMARC policy. With Google too set to migrate to a DMARC <code>p=reject</code> policy in the near future, the importance of the ARC protocol has become more significant.Basically, setting up ARC would allow Mailman to securely register its handling of the message, thus allowing the set-up of a trust mechanism between Mailman and the involved MTAs and hence reducing the denial of service.</p>\n",

          "description": "<h3>User Profile App using ReactJS</h3>\n<p>As a part of modernising the architecture of DHIS 2, we are in the process of rewriting server based system maintenance apps as modern client side web apps. While development of settings app, maintenance app and app-management app is nearly complete, the User Profile App is yet to get started. As part of the GSOC 2016, I propose to develop user profile application for DHIS2. This app will essentially provide a user interface to DHIS2 users to -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View and edit user profile details.</li>\n<li>View and edit user account settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will be using ReactJS view library and will follow a Flux based architecture to write this app. The application's architecture should be such that we can reuse most of its components in other apps using D2-UI. It is important that the overall look and feel of this app matches that of the other new client-side applications. D2 should be extended by adding methods and properties so that it is capable of performing all operations required to view and update user profile and account settings.</p>\n",

The naive perception is often that speech is built with words, and each word consists of phones. The reality is unfortunately very different. Speech is a dynamic process without clearly distinguished parts. It's always useful to get a sound editor and look into the recording of the speech and listen to it.\nAll modern descriptions of speech are to some degree probabilistic. That means that there are no certain boundaries between units, or between words. Speech to text translation and other applications of speech are never 100% correct. That idea is rather unusual for software developers, who usually work with deterministic systems. And it creates a lot of issues specific only to speech technology.\nThe system is intended to develop Language model and Acoustic model to be used for speech recognition of Malayalam Language.</p>\n",

As a result, most of the single cell and neural network models have low RAPT (reproducibility, accessibility, portability and transparency). This has slowed the progress of using biophysically and anatomically detailed neural network models in understanding the brain function in health and disease. In a period of three months during the GSoC placement, I would like to contribute to the Open Source Brain (OSB) Initiative which aims to increase the RAPT of single cell and neural network models. The project will extend the initial work by the OSB on converting the thalamocortical network model by Traub et al. (2005) to the simulator-independent model format, NeuroML2. Firstly, I propose to annotate and implement the tests for spiking behaviour of Traub model cells which are converted to the NeuroML2 format. Secondly, I propose to create a generic Python-based package which can generate different configurations of cortical networks in the NeuroML2 format  and combine unique network components from different cortical network projects.</p>\n",

One method to do this is through trial and error, where a researcher sets the input parameters to specific values based upon their experience, and collects the outputs as sample points to investigate later on (Sedlmair et al.).

This is done by symbolically executing the code block via SPF over JPF in order to generate path constraints for each possible path that a program may take. The path constraints are then put into canonical form and analyzed. Level of refinement of the path constraints dictate the level at which we model programs i.e. If we do not refine the path constraints at all, the program is modeled on a syntactical level. If we stop refinement early, the program is modeled on a semantic level but syntactical structure of the program is still considered. If we  completely refine the path constraints and put them into canonical form, the program is modeled on a semantic level with no consideration towards the syntactical structure of the program. This gives us options on applications of fingerprinting for programs. Further research in this field could result in semantic patterns not just being observed but rather analyzed.

Further in the accompanying theoretical work of Giannakopoulou et al.[1] is shown, that this interfaces are k-full, in case they are safe, permissive, and tight for all method sequences of length up to k, k ϵ ℕ. The evaluation part of the current PSYCO implementation shows that the choice of k heavily influences the runtime behavior of PSYCO. Further it is argued, that it is possible to choose k to a relative small value after a manual analysis of the source code. During my project I will implement a symbolic search on the symbolic transition system produced by JDART to generate possible good choices for k in an automated manner. Apart of the choice of k the symbolic search output can also be used to prove invariants on the analyzed components, e.g., the absence of assertion violations.</p>\n",

The aim of concolic execution is to explore additional behavior in the program by generating input values which will result in a different path being taken through a program (or method). The result of concolic execution is a constraints tree, i.e., a tree with its inner nodes reflecting the decisions that were made during the execution of the program. The nodes on the trees are labeled as: OK if the method was regularly exited, ERROR if there was an exception, or DONT_KNOW if no valuation could be generated for the respective path.</p>\n<p>Currently, the constraints tree is represented only as a plain text file which makes identifying the nodes and the statuses of leaves extremely hard in such a simplistic representation. To provide a better user experience, I will develop a web interface to visualize the constraints trees generated by JDart. At a very basic level, a user will have an intuitive overview on the whole generated trees. At a later stage, I will enable interactive operations on the web interface, e.g. letting user select on which part of a tree JDart should focus on.</p>\n",

It brings significant benefits comparing to normal SQL for search-related uses cases.

          "description": "<p>As of now Marble supports rendering of OpenStreetMap vector data for higher tile levels. In order to make the vector OSM theme complete and end - user ready, support for medium and lower tile levels must be added.</p>\n<p>For supporting low level rendering( levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), Marble should render using the Natural Earth vector dataset instead of the OSM vector dataset. The reason for this is that Natural Earth dataset has categorically arranged data which is required for step by step rendering of lower levels. Apart from this the rendered data should be styled so as to match the OSM theme and tiling support must be added on the server and client side.</p>\n<p>For the medium level tiles, rendering must be performed using the OSM dataset. OSM dataset gives us many small chunks and nodes for a particular geographic data item. These chunks and nodes need to be filtered and reduced to a manageable size for each specific level so as to get optimal performance and less screen clutter.</p>\n<p>Rendering of higher level tiles can be improved by adding rendering support for roof-types and textures tags of buildings.</p>\n",

It is a free open-source software able to provide an accurate graphical representation of the night sky, from any location on Earth, at any date and time. Even though KStars is one of the best planetarium software, it currently has a major drawback: it lacks a fully working Windows version. The actual Windows installing process of KStars is slightly troublesome, especially for a user with no programming background. Therefore, developing a Windows version of KStars is crucial in the further development of KStars as it is one of the main astronomy software out there. It would fill a gap in KStars's reliability and would certainly make KStars more popular and appealing to everyone.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Selecting multiple files in any file manager for copying and pasting has never been a pleasant experience, especially if the files are in a non-continuous order. Often, when selecting files using Ctrl+A or the selection tool, we find that we need to select only a subset of the required files we have selected. This leads to the unwieldy operation of removing files from our selection. Of course, the common workaround is to create a new folder and to put all the items in this folder prior to copying, but this is a very inefficient and very slow process if large files need to be copied. Moreover Ctrl+Click requires fine motor skills to not lose the entire selection of files.</p>\n<p>This is an original project with a novel solution to this problem. My solution is to add a virtual folder in all KIO applications, where the links to files and folders can be temporarily saved. The files and folders are \"staged\" on this virtual folder. Files can be added to this by using all the regular file management operations such as Move, Copy and Paste, or by drag and drop. Hence, complex file operations such as moving files across many devices can be made easy by staging the operation before performing it.</p>\n",

As it is, when you write code on their website and press submit, the code is sent to their server, compiled and the result is sent back. The problem with this, is that it doesn't show the entire capabilities of the language. For instance if you write a program that prints a message every second for 10 seconds, it will return that message printed ten times in an instant. What I want to do by using Emscripten is to have a real time tutorial, so that after the server sends back the result, it will actually print the message every one second, for ten seconds. I will also want to create a second tutorial that implements SDL as well. SDL is a language that can create shapes and interacts with keyboard inputs and the mouse. There already is compatibility between Ceu and SDL and there is also compatibility between SDL and Emscripten. The challenge is to create a synergy with all three languages. I believe this to be feasible, because you can transform a Ceu program into a C program that can then be compiled with Emscripten.</p>\n",

Lifecycle events allow applications to get notifications about the state of the object, as well as for object creation, deletion etc, without having to pull libvirt at regular intervals asking for the state of the VM. This implementation will also include adding support to virt-manager for  storage events.\nAlso, part of the project is extending event-test.py from libvirt-python to watch for storage events and print messages about them, as well as add asynchronous event support for nodedev objects. Also extending the python API for the implementation in virt-manager and libvirt-python.\nAfter the implementation of the storage API, project includes implementation of asynchronous event support for nodedev objects, followed by extending the python API, implementation in virt-manager and in libvirt-python. When this part is finished, I'll continue working on nodedev, and add event support for udev and netcf drivers.</p>\n",

When creating a virtualized guest, one needs to tell libvirt, among other things, what one wants the virtualized hardware to look like. \nTo achieve this, one provides an XML file in the domain XML format. In these files, device addresses show up in many places. In order to make libvirt convenient to use, device addresses are sometimes autogenerated. There are also some constraints on these addresses.\nCurrently, code to deal with device addresses is scattered across the codebase.

          "description": "<p>Transparency in conceptualizing, creating, and circulating a model is respected within the scientific community; however, open sharing of these has yet to rise as a commonplace practice. Distribution of models in the form of open-source modules is needed to initiate freer discourse in the scientific world, where the development of interdisciplinary fields has served to the end of establishing specificity of focus instead of fostering a more holistic and collaborative approach to investigation.The McGill Space Institute (MSI) is an organization located at the crossroads of astronomy, biology, and earth sciences, embodying an archetype characterized by transparency, sharing, and collaboration: facets reflected in open-source culture. By developing three pieces of code for a model of an important microbial metabolism, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, we can meet the interests of MSI researchers from all walks. In making a single core model available to these three sub-groups of workers in formats that are compatible with their existing working methods and languages of choice, it is possible to set a precedent in the encouragement of transdisciplinary collaboration in science.</p>\n",

This in turn gives the user, the ability to add components at runtime and instantiate them when necessary. This feature can boost the memory management in App inventor by assigning memory when needed. \nThe proposal also marks the enhancement of file access. The app inventor currently doesn't support the access of External Storage in general. The proposal focuses on adding this feature so that many apps such as file managers can be made.

Moreover, MRPT provides several types of Particle Filters such as PF with Standard and Optimal [Grisetti et al., 2007] Proposals, as well as an Approximate Optimal Sampling [Blanco et al., 2008a]. Thus, existing <em>slam_gmapping</em> package features only a subset of this functionality and robotics community will benefit greatly from being able to use implementation offered by MRPT library.

The position is eliminated using least squares formulation. This leads to the possibility to solve the estimation problem in a closed form w.r.t. the rotation matrix. The proposed algorithm will break new grounds in computer vision and can be extended for pose estimation using Stereo vision.

This way ModSecurity cores becomes completely independent of underlying web server.

Cytoscape is open-source software that is popular (6350 citations as of March 22nd 2016) for the visualization of networks. As scientists work with increasing amounts of data and the expectation of reproducible computational analyses increases, many users of network visualization programs are turning to scripted analyses instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI). \nCytoscape has an application programming interface (API) that uses the Representational State Transfer (REST) to send information between Cytoscape and different programs. The package RCy3  allows users to connect R to Cytoscape allowing them to script their visualizations. There are two ways the package would be enhanced: 1) by enabling the use of Cytoscape plugins programmatically through their API, and  2) by creating robust walkthroughs of the code necessary to use RCy3 and other packages for reproducible network visualizations. The walkthroughs would include approaches relevant to many Cytoscape users and incorporate the programmatic use of plugins with developed function.</p>\n",

Cytoscape’s core implements generic network integration and visualization capabilities through its core apps and can be extended to suite specific use-cases by developing Cystoscape apps using its extensible plugin architecture.</p>\n<p>While Cytoscape’s graphical user interface is very useful for interactive network data integration and visualization, it may not be the best choice for workflows with hundreds if not thousands of network data files. Cytoscape includes the commandTool app to provide a command-line interface to Cytoscape using the Commands API. Cytoscape apps can register commands using annotations, and these commands will then be available in commandTool. Users can execute commands (eg importing networks from file or importing tables) using Command Line Dialog and can see the result in the Reply Log. The commandTool can also execute scripts (each line is  a set of commands) and provide help about command classes and namespaces using the Command API.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Tutorials serve as an invaluable way to familiarize oneself with new software. Cytoscape.js currently provides demos but lacks tutorials to tie together many ideas into a fully realized implementation. This project entails writing comprehensive but easy-to-understand tutorials which demonstrate the power of Cytoscape.js, both to those new to the project and to those wishing to tackle more ambitious projects with Cytoscape.js. I envision a set of tutorials moving from a level just beyond the demos, to a tutorial that details the creation of both mobile and web apps. \nBased on the current demos, I feel that there are enough examples of possible Cytoscape.js based webapps but each needs more documentation. There is very little guidance provided to new users as to why each demo works the way it does. To use a car metaphor, it seems like the demos are oriented more for going from 60 - 100 mph than 0-60. \nAs mentioned in the provided description, each demo exhibits a single concept rather than tying them all together. Tutorials will tie together the disparate demos into more powerful (while still easy to understand) examples of Cytoscape.js</p>\n",

It is translated to a peptide by the ribosome, and then further modified to give the active final product. RiPPs can be divided in more than 20 sub-classes and have a wide range of biological functions:  among others, they can work as antibiotics, nutritional additives or food preservatives. Thus, the use of RiPPs as drugs is increasing and several RiPP derivatives are already in advanced phases of clinical trials.\nIn this project, prediction modules for a number of RiPP clusters will be developed. Working together with the mentors, who can provide technical and scientific advice, antiSMASH plug-ins will be created to allow researchers to identify the RiPP precursor gene, identify the cleavage sites of the core peptide and predict further modifications to its sctructure. With these plug-ins, we hope to accelerate all the research involving RiPPs and consequently, shorten the time “between the bench and the bed” for possible new drugs.</p>\n",

The project aims to extend the Chemical JSON format with the different data points that cclib can parse, and have cclib pass this extended Chemical JSON to Avogadro-2 via a simple command call. To display the information being provided by the Chemical JSON, the functionality to read and render specific data points will have to be implemented in Avogadro-2. \nThis abstraction of restricting the data exchange to Chemical JSON greatly limits the dependency of Avogadro-2 on cclib. In the future, this interface can be extended by another data parsing library to provide information in a standard format (i.e. Chemical JSON); building upon the powerful plugin architecture on which Avogadro-2 is designed upon.</p>\n",

Second, to develop a “Go-Docker executor/runner” which can be used as any other scheduler (i.e. SGE, Torque …).</p>\n",

The software can start up and run on the container more and more quickly. The Dockstore is a platform for users to share tools encapsulated in Docker. Furthermore, in order to share tools as seamlessly as possible, GA4GH create a set of APIs for the biology scientists. In this project, I would like to make the Dockstore support these APIs. In this way, people can create their tools based on the APIs so that their tools can be work with others’ tools seamlessly. It will absolutely help the cooperation between scientists due to they can create their tools based on or cooperate with others’ more easily. Our project has three main goals. The first is to communicate with GA4GH community so as to decide the APIs standard and their implementations. Then, I need to implement and test these APIs with java so that the Dockstore can support the APIs. The last goal is realize cross indexing of tools across all sites that support the standard. When finish cross indexing, Dockstore can search all the tools from all websites which support the standard.</p>\n",

In some applications, adjustments to nominal paths must be made based on sensor feedback or operator input. The issues were raised at ROSCON 2015 . The specific application driving this need is robotic assembly using end-effector force feedback, where parts such as computer board components need placement in holes or sockets with tight clearances, and the object locations may vary considerably with a need to locate them using vision systems. Achieving reactive and adaptive path planning may require extensions to several parts of ROS and ROS-Industrial, including the MoveIt! or Descartes path planners, the ROS control layer, or the Simple Message protocol to hardware robot controllers. Development can take place without actual force sensors or cameras, using simulated sources of the high-level outputs of these sensors in terms of small adjustments that affect the trajectories. The key software objective is to put in place a method to adjust trajectories after they have been nominally planned, rather than focusing on sensor processing.</p>\n",

Main limitation of stitching pipeline is it expected camera model (perspective transformation). Although this model is fine for many applications working with camera captured images, there are applications which aren't covered by current stitching pipeline.</p>\n<p>Due to physical constraints it is possible for some applications to expect much simpler transform with less degrees of freedom. Those are situations when input data are not subject to perspective transform. The transformation can be much simpler, such as affine tranformation.

          "description": "<p>Deep Learning (DL) and especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has drawn a lot of attention in last few years. At present day CNN has been successfully applied in various fields of Computer Vision, for example: image classification [1, 2, 3], semantic segmentation [4], object detection [5], human pose estimation [6], etc. \nAlso some of the recent researches have tried to apply discriminating power of CNN for visual tracking purposes: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Almost all of them outperform state-of-art tracking algorithms (like TLD [12], KCF [13]) in terms of accuracy, but lose in terms of speed.\nOne of the most recent successful trackers based on CNN are MDNet and GOTURN. Though MDNet has been evaluated as a top – accuracy tracker (1-st place on VOT2015), it suffers from low performance (~1 FPS) due to CNN online learning. While GOTURN can run on around 100 FPS maintaining high accuracy and robustness (close to MDNet). Good speed/accuracy tradeoff makes GOTURN one of the most promising next-generation trackers. So this proposal aims to implement GOTURN tracker in OpenCV library.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>GSoc 2015 brought structured light to OpenCV and I would love to extend the module this year. Among all the available algorithms, phase-shifting profilometry (PSP) is one of the most popular and I believe OpenCV would benefit from its implementation. Unfortunately, PSP does not perform well on dynamic scenes since it belongs to time-multiplexing methods. Indeed, successive patterns are not deformed in the same way which leads to reconstruction errors. To reduce reconstruction errors due to motion, scientists had the idea to combine PSP with Fourier transform profilometry (FTP), a one-shot method that uses the same patterns. My goal for GSoC 2016 is to add PSP, FTP and Fourier assisted phase-shifting profilometry (FAPS) to OpenCV.  Spatial phase unwrapping, which is essential to PSP, FTP and FAPS, will be coded as an independent module due to its broad number of applications. Finally, as a proof of concept of scene understanding from structured light, an automatic piecewise-planar surfaces detection will be tested on the results provided by Fourier transform profilometry.</p>\n",

The correctness of the resulting routes is not ensured. Furthermore, many of the already mapped routes are in need for validation and correction. The proposed GSoC project will provide the functionality for a more convenient editing of public transport routes either by creating new ways between stops with a routing algorithm or by replicating them from existing public transport routes. Furthermore, it will elaborate criteria of route correctness and validate the existing routes against those criteria. There are Python scripts written by Polyglot to find ways that belong to a route described by its stops and to compare a given route to an already existing route. However, their installation requires additional steps, so for a better usability an extended version of this functionality needs to be implemented as part of the JOSM public transport plugin.</p>\n",

The proposed solution shall allow users of the istSOS ecosystem to configure, customize and include a wide set of chart, bar, grid and map visualization types in their websites. The framework will offer complete support for the connection of the visualization widgets with multiple data-exchange formats like CSV, TSV and JSON. Considering the real-time nature of the data sources the framework will support the generation of real-time visualization widgets specially crafted to improve the readiness to display data of this kind. The framework shall be implemented with robustness, reliability and customization as its core development principles. Recommended practices for software development like Version Control Systems use and continous testing will be followed.</p>\n",

Each voxel has three dimensions, that will be possible to customize with the interested metadata, but also more information can be shown thanks to Web World Wind capabilities. Coloring each Voxel might present another metadata and additionally creating an animation in time gives the opportunity to introduce a further variable. \n Users will be able to interact with the visualization, customizing the metadata on the Voxel and filtering data according to specific settings. \n As input data, I'm considering telecommunication data from \"Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge 2015\". \nMy idea is to create first the visualization environment and further import the data in a database to allow users to query the database for particular data. \nMoreover, depending on the time also would be interesting to allow users to import their own data set in a specific format to share the view on a specific globe with other people.</p>\n",

Very simple animations can often efficiently communicate abstract ideas, especially in technical fields. However, with many of the currently available tools, designing even simple animations can involve heavy design loads which technically inclined creators are not always eager to carry. This project aims to solve this issue by providing simple tools to create expressive GIFs by writing small scripts. The scripting language provides means to describe technical animations by typing code, instead of relying on click-and-drag interfaces of most design programs, which is in fact more practical when the animation we intend to create involves objects describable mathematically or programmatically.\nThe core tool will thus be a small program which takes a script written by the user and outputs the GIF animation described in the script.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Implementation of various tags in profile page which improves community interaction in PublicLab.org organization and also improving the response time of profile page.</p>\n<p>Profile tags are a creative tool that lets PublicLab.org users add tags to their profile which highlights the things that describe them. Main focus of this project is to add various profile tags such as location data, role, tools, skills to user profiles which improves user base community side interaction. Improving the current Barnstar implementation by providing a new layout in profile page. In the current system, comments are displayed with image icon and description which will be refactored based on the role user possess such as admin, moderator, organizer. On the other hand as huge amount of data is rendered in the front end of the application, response time is another important factor project will focus on. I will be using agile software development method which includes iterative and incremental approach</p>\n<p>My work can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/commits/master?author=lalithr95\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/commits/master?author=lalithr95</a></p>\n",

Generally, the more data the better conclusions can be drawn. However, many projects suffer from having not enough volunteers and therefore collected data. This projects goal is to dramatically reduce the barrier for non-technical people to become volunteers. To achieve this goal, a serial communication via headphone socket will be established. With WebRTC the signals can be captured in a browser, making installation of addtional software unnecessary.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>MDAnalysis provides a python framework to allow users to analyse Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Umbrella Sampling (US) is an MD technique which involves performing a series of simulations in which a ‘reaction coordinate’ – such as distance between two molecules – is restrained to different values. Simulation data can be combined, usually using the WHAM method, to produce a ‘potential of mean force’ (PMF) profile that shows the energy landscape along the chosen coordinate. Several implementations of WHAM exist, but require input files of specific formats which may differ from that obtained directly from the simulation, dependent on the simulation engine used. Additionally, it would be convenient be able to calculate the PMF alongside analysis of the trajectory such as offered by MDAnalyisis. However, MDAnalysis does not yet have tools specifically for dealing with and analysing US simulations. This project aims to introduce capabilities for loading US simulation sets, including a generalised tool for loading auxiliary data files, and performing WHAM and other basic analysis.</p>\n",

People who research AI, are experimenting with various intelligence models in order to discover a strong intelligence model which is equally capable with the unknown human model. Prototyping of such models (as large as they may be) needs to be as fast as possible, in order to examine exhaustively many novel ideas as fast as it can be done. For this we need to be able to use with ease as many resources as we have possible. As Theano is contributing to this attempt, current GPU technologies need to be supported extensively in a transient way through its framework. This can be achieved by including optimized operations from current NVidia frameworks, as well as optimizing or designing GPU code which resides in the framework’s backend. Furthermore, analysis and optimization of multi-gpu code, in addition with a consideration of a multi-node/gpu design, would prove themselves useful for this cause.</p>\n",

Signaling is also exposed via the core API of Scrapy for use in extensions/middleware. The current signaling mechanism is based on the <code>pydispatcher</code> library which although does serve the purpose well often tends to be slower than the actual HTML parsing and tends to bottleneck spiders(see: <a href=\"https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/8#issuecomment-112029296\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/8#issuecomment-112029296</a>).

Implementing coroutines will be the main feature of this project, as this feature offers more new methods than the other features. PEP 465 shows that Matrix multiplication is already used more often than bitwise operations in numeric libraries. Also, having coroutines with async and await syntax as well as enhanced unpacking options, the possibility that Python 3.5 syntax will be used in upcoming code rises. Therefore, an implementation of these features in PyPy3 will definitely increase compatibility to future Python 3 programs. In order to support PyPy’s Python 3 compatibility even further, other new features of Python 3.5 and 3.4 will be implemented after finishing the three PEPs if there is enough time, starting with the enum module of 3.4 and continuing with PEP 461 to allow support of the % formatting operator to bytes and bytearrays.</p>\n",

With Pandas readily available for most users, this is tedious fait accompli for users, since the core data model for PySAL's API was designed before Pandas existed. While newer projects have attempted to extend Pandas for geographic data, those packages have difficult-to-install dependencies that make them inaccessible for many end users, and make design decisions which the author thinks are somewhat suboptimal for PySAL's use case. Therefore, I propose to specify and implement a tabular spatial data model in Python leveraging Pandas dataframes directly, rather than through subclassing. This follows in the spatialite idea that spatial data is first data, then spatial. Thus, tooling must focus on enabling spatial operations directly on Pandas dataframes by exploiting column dtype information and dispatching appropriately, instead of a subclassing approach. In the end, this project would result in a simpler data model for PySAL.</p>\n",

This project proposes to use a more robust and efficient method for automatically denoising diffusion MRI and structural MR datasets, using Local-PCA. Along with an accurate implementation of L-PCA and its adaptation to Rician noise, the project will also aim at optimising the implementation of L-PCA using Cython. \nAfter implementing L-PCA, a method for robust brain extraction needs to be developed. DIPY’s median OTSU based implementation is known not work so well with non-echo planar diffusion imaging (non-EPI dMRI) data. There are few possible ways to improve this, one is to generate labels and have weighted median OTSU. Another idea involves using some version of patch based segmentation using image library constructed from previously annotated images and using it as a reference for the subsequent extraction.</p>\n",

The project will include completing the process of sending the leftover memory pages.\nProject would start by making sure that the threads do not fail at both the source and destination end. This would be followed by re-establishing the network connection between the source and the destination. After this is done, the migration process is restarted.

Materials of interest could include roadways, vegetation, and specific targets (i.e. pollutants, hazardous materials, etc.). Trivially, each pixel of a hyperspectral image could be compared to a material database to determine the type of material making up the pixel. However, many hyperspectral imaging platforms have low resolution (&gt;5m per pixel) causing each pixel to be a mixture of several materials. The process of unmixing one of these 'mixed' pixels is called hyperspectral image unmixing or simply hyperspectral unmixing.\nThere is an R package for this purposes however, the already implemented methods N-FINDR and VCA make one crucial assumption: they assume the presence of pure spectra of all components are available somewhere in the data. Obviously, while this assumption is reasonable for some applications, other applications exist where this assumption should not be relied on.

The functionalities developed concerns search functions, the improvement of the  several tools (hexdump, disasm...) and the development of the graph module with a new library with the ability to have more representations. This project will also permit the usage of the T command of r2 binary to send and read messages through the UI. In the same way, the scripting area that allows the user to make some automation will be improved to be more friendly and authorize new usages. In resume, this work will allow to improve drastically the comfort in the use of r2.</p>\n",

Also, a caffe independent pure RoboComp based implementation for forward pass will be developed for a selected CNN. Another component based on open scene graph will designed that would allow reading of CAD models and interfacing with current RoboComp simulation framework.

A Capture Engine buffers trace data in SMP-safe manner and records it on the target. RTEMS uses its own format for the traces. In this project we propose to modify the tracing framework to generate traces in the standardized Common Trace Format (CTF). CTF is a bit-packed trace-format used by a range of monitoring and visualisation tools (eg. Babeltrace). In the next phase, I will implement live-tracing functionality over a set of popular transport mechanisms(eg. USB, JTAG). Using LTTng tools we can visualise and analyse these live-traces on the host. I will focus on measuring and minimizing the overhead added due to tracing.</p>\n",

There is a recent trend to integrate aspects of both disciplines, commonly by \"adding types\" to languages originally designed as dynamic.</p>\n<p>There has been interest in the Ruby community to explore such an approach: Yukihiro Matsumoto devoted his keynote at RubyConf 2014 to the potential implementation of static typing in the language. The topic is complex: a Ruby tightly corseted by types would not be true to the essence of the language.</p>\n<p>Under a gradual typing discipline, type annotations can be specified at will: interesting parts of the program can be given explicit types and their type safety checked statically. We propose an implementation of gradual typing in Matz's Ruby Interpreter, drawing inspiration from similar additions to other dynamic languages, with strictly optional type annotations consistent with Ruby's DRY and \"lazy\" philosophy and an evaluation of the practical usefulness of gradual typing.</p>\n",

It is common to implement optimized data structures when working in C, but it should not impose users of the high level languages like Ruby to the task of implementing optimized data structures by themselves. However, it is necessary to select appropriate data structures in order to achieve efficient access to the data structures.</p>\n<p>It seems possible to offer some implementations per data structure in Ruby, and select it implicitly in order to offer desirable performance without difficulty to the users.</p>\n<p>For example, List is a basic structure for programmers, but Ruby does not offer it. Instead, Ruby programmers use Array. In fact, Array offers List like methods such as insert, delete, push back and more.

We say two self-maps of projective space are equivalent if there is an element of the Projective Linear Group that conjugates one to the other. The following two algorithms should be implemented, in order to create more functionality in moduli space.\nThe first algorithm would be that given two endomorphisms of projective space determine if they are conjugate. In other words, determine if they are in the same class in the moduli space. If they are, also return the PGL element that conjugates one to the other.The second algorithm would be that given an endomorphism of projective space to compute a reduced form. This conjugation would that makes the coefficients small. There is already an algorithm implemented to return the minimal model in terms of resultant, but the coefficients can be non-optimal. The simplest approach would be to reduce the binary form describing the fixed points or if the binary form describing the fixed points is not sufficiently nice then reduce the binary form for points of period n for some small n.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Scilab being a software used worldwide, needs to focus on how its users (potential developers) interact with Scilab and how comfortable they are with using the features  provided by Scilab. Scilab already incorporates the facility to make figures such as tables labels etc and allows insertion and manipulation of data. Unfortunately even though the  facility is provided the features have been found buggy and not well documented making its usage very limited and  which incapacitates the current users and fails to attract new users .There are some most wanted features like spreadsheets, progress bar etc which are not present and are highly wished for by the users of Scilab,and others.</p>\n<p>My aim is to improve/upgrade the already existing facility to such a level that the users become very comfortable using it and to further introduce much needed user interface elements in Scilab User Interface Control to make it most favoured software. My work starts with modifying and documenting Uitables and Uitrees and extends upto incorporating ProgressBar. These development would solve major issues with GUI,would attract more users to Scilab and would help in retaining already existing users</p>\n",

I also aim to develop a new parameter framework to improve the syntax of the API which is exposed to the user via SWIG.

In this project, I will develop modules in 3D Slicer to read/write, visualize and process high-resolution images used in digital pathology, which can occupy tens of gigabytes and cannot be comfortably uncompressed into RAM.  So far, I have developed a standalone application importing and visualizing the high-resolution large images utilizing PyQt and openslide-python. The interactive front panel is shown in the following Additional Info URL. The image region being visualized is defined by multiple parameters by users. This summer, I will implement scripted modules (Python) incorporating functionalities of Openslide, VTK, Qt, Slice libraries and Medical Reality Markup Language (MRML) to do streaming I/O and sub-region based processing of the images.</p>\n",

As the amount of data becomes extreme large, normal computing methods cannot handle such a volume. Running Big Data on Spark ecosystems might be a reasonable way. Its capability to compute data at large scale give us a good solution. However, most of data are unlabeled data; and labeling data not only means highly cost but also requires expertise in that domain.  That is to say, using Supervised Learning algorithms might be unreasonable. In addition, Semi-supervised learning might not be a good way too as for its assumptions need some particular data distributions. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering-based) is a good start step towards this problem. \n       Thus, in this project, I am trying to solve this problem by two phases: retrieving data from Elasticsearch-Hadoop; building a statistical analysis tool on Spark streaming computing from a clustering perspective.

Currently, SymEngine has the implementation of Univariate Polynomial class, which provides us the basic functionality to add, multiply and subtract two polynomials.</p>\n<p>Now, comes the problem of factoring the polynomials and then other modular arithmetics and, <code>gcd</code> and <code>lcm</code>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we need to have a module, which can convert the polynomial into a finite field (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_field\" target=\"_blank\">Galois Field</a>), do basic operations of <code>add</code>, <code>mul</code>, <code>div</code> etc. on them and then the algorithms for factorization like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%E2%80%93Zassenhaus_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\">Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlekamp's_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\">Berlekamp's algorithm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After doing factorization, we will be able to find roots, which in turn will help us to solve univariate polynomial equations. Then for returning solution, <code>Set</code> are the simplest and most intuitive way. Like in real pen-paper exam, we are supposed to return solutions in form of sets.

And having the ability to solve a variety of equations, with accuracy, adds new dimensions to the system. Currently, SymPy has two different APIs for solving equations- the old <code>solve</code> and the new <code>solveset</code>. The <code>solveset</code> module is based on a <code>Set</code> based results while the <code>solve</code> uses a <code>list</code> for the same. Recently, there has been a lot of development around the <code>solveset</code> to replace <code>solve</code>. The major issues with merging <code>solveset</code> with <code>solve</code> are that the lack of solvers for univariate Transcendental Equations and Multivariate equations. I, on my part, intend to implement these solvers to extend the solveset module and make it more robust.</p>\n",

While many people working together on various functionalities - there are possibilities for anything to break and go undetected for a long time.

Testing a scientific code like TARDIS is crucial - apart from the main code base, the test suite needs to be up-to-date and should have a good code coverage.  This project focuses on development of an extensive test suite - which will stretch and probe many functionalities of TARDIS to make sure everything functions properly. But these test setups are very complex, hence testing is slow and resource extensive.\nSolution - this testing project ! Enabling slow tests to be run at regular intervals on a dedicated server, generating comparison plots and notification of test status through email - these are the assets which are targeted to be added with TARDIS by completion of the project.</p>\n",

In such cases unsupervised learning is a great first step beyond simply picking a random tag or the most frequent form according to some corpus statistics. The way CG is currently combined with the tagger works reasonably well empirically but is actually somewhat unsound in terms of the theory of operation of the tagger (words are identified by different ambiguity classes during training and tagging). For my first task, I will implement new ways of combining them both during in tagging and during tagger training .</p>\n<p>For my second task I will implement an averaged perception POS tagger based on the one in the Python module nltk. This will have some level of configurability in terms of word features (ie can choose to look at suffixes or prefixes of different lengths) to accommodate different types of languages. Another requirement will be to work (not necessarily very well) with little or no configuration (which means eventually not using the coarse tags of the other taggers).</p>\n",

Therefore, malware analysis tools dissect and analyze the behavior of malicious entities at run-time. In this way, security analysts can deduct the cause of infection, e.g., to provide necessary means for potential countermeasures. DRAKVUF is an open source malware analysis framework running on top of the Xen hypervisor. By using Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) techniques, DRAKVUF is able to transparently monitor and control the state of a virtual machine from a level beyond the OS. While DRAKVUF is a powerful means to analyze malware, its use is currently limited to x86-64 based architectures. This project aims to shift the scope of application of DRAKVUF towards ARM and thus the mobile market ultimately providing powerful malware analysis on mobile devices.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Julia is a dynamic programming language that, over the past few years, gained interest in the open-source community, especially in the field of scientific computing. Julia programs are executed by a virtual machine that translates the source code, during run-time, to machine code based on the LLVM compiler framework. LLVM provides a variety of analyses and transformation capabilities that are leveraged to optimize programs and facilitate efficient execution. More recently, LLVM was enhanced by a new optimization framework, namely Polly, that supports automatic parallelization and data-locality optimizations based on the polyhedral model. Polly is able to speed up compute kernels significantly, especially in the context of dense linear algebra and iterative stencil computations. In the course of this project I plan to integrate Polly into Julia to enable polyhedral optimizations for Julia programs.</p>\n",

While many solvers are currently found in ODE.jl, there are still many which are awaiting a native Julia implementation in the package. In particular, there is a lack of implicit solvers implemented in ODE.jl (currently, there is only one implicit solver: ode23s). Such solvers are important because they are especially suited for solving stiff ODEs, which are very common. In light of this, the first goal of my proposed project is a native implementation of implicit solvers RADAU and MEBDFI. Further, in order to reliably use ODE.jl, a robust initial value problem (IVP) testing suite for ODE.jl solvers is a necessity. Work has has been started towards this end through the development of IVPTestSuite.jl. Though, there are many improvements to IVPTestSuite.jl which could be made, especially in improving the ODE solver performance tracking. Thus, the second goal of my proposed project is to advance IVPTestSuite.jl and its surrounding documentation.</p>\n",

However, due to the lack of a machine-specific performance model and missing optimizations, these transformations sometimes lead to compile and execution time regressions, and the generated code is at least one order of magnitude off in comparison to the corresponding vendor implementations. The goal of the project is to reduce such influence through implementation of optimizations aimed to produce code compatible with the best implementations of BLAS and an attempt to avoid vectorization of loops, when it is not profitable for the target architecture.

In addition, this project will enable the new destination to act as a WebSocket server,  so the WebSocket client (such as a javascript client in a browser) could subscribe directly to it to get log messages.  These will make sending log message privately or  publicly much easier.\nThis project will add WebSocket as a source for sysnlog-ng.

The Tor community is fully aware of the problem and the Tor browser has been modified to follow the \"one fingerprint for all\" approach. However, due to the constant evolution of the web and its underlying technologies, it has become a true challenge to always stay ahead of the latest fingerprinting techniques.</p>\n<p>For this Google Summer of Code project, I propose to develop the Fingerprint Central website that will run a fingerprinting test suite and collect data from Tor browsers to help developers design and test new defences against browser fingerprinting. The website will be similar to AmIUnique.org or Panopticlick for users where they will get a complete summary with statistics after the test suite has been executed. It can be used to test new fingerprinting protection as well as making sure that fingerprinting-related bugs were correctly fixed with specific regression tests. The expected long-term impact of this project is to reduce the differences between Tor users and reinforce their privacy and anonymity online.</p>\n",

Such visualization will be useful in characterising the context of the search token and can be applied in semantic, lexical, typological, or disourse analysis.</p>\n",

The above framework should be implemented in an object-oriented fashion, making use of the modular &gt;&gt;Open Energy System Modelling Framework&lt;&lt; (Oemof).

For each such article, the bot aims to accomplish the following tasks:\n(1) Flag passages with facts and statistics which are likely to have become out of date and have not been updated in a given number of years\n(2) Flag phrases which are likely unclear\n(3) Flag bad student edits</p>\n<p>Flagged instances are then stored in a database and open to the reviewers for reviewing and closing the flags. A reviewer can decide to either 'Accept' or 'Dismiss' a review item as valid/invalid. Two reviewers decide the fate of each review item, and in the case of a conflict, it is sent to a third reviewer. Reviewer reputation scores are computed based on a mechanism of acceptability of reviews by other peer reviewers. Reviews which lowered the scores can be optionally displayed to the reviewers.</p>\n",
